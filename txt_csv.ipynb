    "\n",
    "Kenyan teachers have at least three months in a year when they are free to do side hustles. The best hustles for them are those that do not disrupt their regular teaching activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since salaries for teachers aren’t sufficient enough to afford basic needs and luxuries, a side hustle is important. Below are some of the most ideal side hustles for Kenyan teachers, some of them would make them millionaires.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Farming*\n",
    "\n",
    "Farming is the best side hustle for teachers who would prefer earning extra cash outside their full time job. The most profitable crops to grow include: tomatoes, cabbages, carrots, spinach and kales.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also plant onions, watermelon and mangoes. You need a capital of as little as Ksh.10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Holiday Tuition*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are parents who need their children to study during holidays. If you are a good teacher, they will definitely look for you. Alternatively, you can market your skills online, especially on Facebook, viusasa, youtube and you can even do online classes using zoom.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I finished high school, I remember back then, I used to do holiday tuition for Ksh.200 per day. The money was sweet and sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a teacher engages in holiday tuition, he will grow faster than teachers who relax when they are not on session.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Posho mill business*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you work in a village setting, think about posho mill business, it’s profitable. Posho mill is easy to manage, you only require one employee, probably a relative. The capital needed is less than Ksh.200,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a month, a posho mill will yield more than Ksh.30,000 in profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Online tuition classes*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have seen Babu Owino providing online classes and Kenyans were excited about that. I will advise you to start a blog where you post education materials and earn from AdSense and sponsored content.\n",
    " \n",
    "In addition, start a YouTube channel. Through your online media, you will be able to reach out to many Kenyans and eventually start getting offline jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a blog, you require less than Ksh.25,000, that’s domain registration, web hosting and web design services.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Selling clothes and shoes to your workmates and community members*\n",
    "\n",
    "Start a boutique shop where you will sell clothes and shoes to your workmates and members of the community. The staff room will provide an ideal environment to advertise your products.\n",
    "\n",
    "The teachers will introduce you to their friends, relatives and neighbours. You can also start a Facebook page where you advertise the products.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Build rental houses*\n",
    "\n",
    "Rental houses are the best source of recurring income. Some of your fellow teachers will be staying in your houses and pay you at the end of the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Selling revision papers online*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also start a blog, Facebook page or WhatsApp group where you sell revision papers online. You can target all classes/grades but focus more on standard 8 and form fours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect all the past KCPE and KCSE papers, then get the answers and post online. If someone wants to access them, they have to pay to get a password. Charge Ksh.50 per paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a day, you can sell over 100 papers if you market your business well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to include mock papers for various districts and national schools. Later, include college and university past papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dairy farming*\n",
    "\n",
    "Dairy farming is also ideal for Kenyan teachers. Since most teachers work near their ancestral homes, they won’t find any problem with what to feed the cows and how to manage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your aim is to have 2 to 10 cows which will yield at least 2,000 litres of milk per month.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Tent and chairs business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Another business that’s doing well is tent and chairs business for hire. There are many celebration and events going on in the village and it will be to your advantage if you buy chairs and tents which will be hired.\n",

    "Also our Real Estate Business training will be on weekdays only, Monday to Friday, excluding weekends so that those who will be busy during the weekdays can catch up with our training over the weekend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a schedule of what will be learnt in each day of our training.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 1: Buying and selling land*\n",
    "\n",
    "We will teach you about buying land, holding it for some time and selling it later at a profit (land appreciation), Buying land subdividing it into smaller pieces and selling them profitably, Buying land and developing it before selling it at a profit and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 2: Building and selling homes*\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who choose to build houses for sale do make money too. If the cost of building a house is 3 million the developer sells it at 4 to 6 million. We will teach you on how you can venture into this business too.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 3: Buying Buildings/Homes, Developing them and Selling/Letting them*\n",
    "\n",
    "Old homes do appreciate in value too. We will teach you on how you can buy old buildings and homes, renovate them and Sell/Lent them out at a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 4: Becoming a Real Estate Agent/Broker*\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need money to make money in real estate. All you need is to be smart and work smart. People in Kenya are crazy about land. Everybody wants to have a piece of land. The demand is so high. Work to bring two parties looking for each other together and make money in the process. Your job will be to find a distressed seller and a motivated buyer. We will teach more about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 5: Become a landlord*\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people buy land to build homes or rental properties while others buy, hold and sell at a higher price in the future. We will teach you on how you can invest in rental properties (both residential and commercial) profitably. \n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 6: Developing Vacation Rentals*\n",
    "\n",
    "These are short-term rentals. And they are popular with tourists, celebrities, the rich, playboys, and slay queens. This is a very profitable area of real estate we will teach you about. Vacation rentals are like hideout spaces for those who can afford them. In a hotel, you are in public but in a vacation rental, you get the privacy you deserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 7: Become a Real Estate Investor*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have access to larger sums of money you can become a real estate investor. Some investors like to get involved while others are more like angel investors. We will teach you on how you can be a profitable real estate investor without getting yourself involved directly in real estate business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 8: Lease Property*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can’t afford to buy you can lease a property for some years. All you need is a lease agreement (or contract.) Then use the leased property to make money. You could lease land for agriculture purposes or you could use the land for any other profitable commercial undertaking. We will teach you more about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 9: Start a Construction Company*\n",
    "\n",
    "As the economy develops, more people are acquiring land for building property. They need a construction company or manager who will facilitate the construction of the property on behalf of them. We will teach you on how to start a construction company and how to get real estate construction contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 10: Starting a Hardware/Construction Materials Supply Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kenyan real estate sector is growing so fast – forming fertile grounds for hardware businesses to thrive steadily. And if you have been keen enough, then you must have already noticed that hardware businesses are mushrooming almost everywhere in the country. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hardware business is so profitable yet still unavailable in some areas – leaving room for you to join the millionaire hardware owners in the business. We will teach you more about this business. \n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 11: Property Management*\n",
    "\n",
    "Property management is the process of owning your own company and managing properties. This could be a rental home, vacation home, or even apartment complexes and businesses. You as the property manager would be in charge of accepting the rent, taking service calls, showing the property if you needed a new tenant, taking care of any disputes that may occur about the property, and maybe even marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 12: Construction/Industrial Cleaning Service*\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial and residential buildings that construction has been completed need cleaning. We will teach you on how you can venture into the business of offering cleaning services of constructed buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies regularly need a home cleaned prior to its being remodeled or lived in again by a new tenant. This is also the case for landlords before allowing someone new to move in. If you wanted to go to the commercial route you could start a contract with commercial companies cleaning and offering monthly maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 13: Interior Designing*\n",
    "\n",
    "This business is currently among the most popular real estate business ideas all across the world. Based on the area of the space, the designer charges around Ksh.1,000 per sqft and this can go upto 10,000 as well, if you're looking for design alone. However, inclusive of products, carpentry i.e, modular kitchen and wardrobes, flooring and ceiling, this price can shoot upto Ksh.30,000 per sqft. We will teach you more on how you can make money with Interior Designing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 14: Landscaping*\n",
    "\n",
    "Landscaping business or lawn care is one of the most lucrative businesses in the agro-based service industry. This green business also allows you to operate from home with small startup capital.

    "\n",
    "*DAY 4: Becoming a Real Estate Agent/Broker*\n",
    "\n",

The demand is so high. Work to bring two parties looking for each other together and make money in the process. Your job will be to find a distressed seller and a motivated buyer. We will teach more about this.\n",

    "\n",
    "These are short-term rentals. And they are popular with tourists, celebrities, the rich, playboys, and slay queens. This is a very profitable area of real estate we will teach you about.

    "\n",
    "*DAY 7: Become a Real Estate Investor*\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*DAY 8: Lease Property*\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*DAY 9: Start a Construction Company*\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*DAY 10: Starting a Hardware/Construction Materials Supply Business*\n",

    "\n",
    "*DAY 12: Construction/Industrial Cleaning Service*\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial and residential buildings that construction has been completed need cleaning. We will teach you on how you can venture into the business of offering cleaning services of constructed buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies regularly need a home cleaned prior to its being remodeled or lived in again by a new tenant. This is also the case for landlords before allowing someone new to move in. If you wanted to go to the commercial route you could start a contract with commercial companies cleaning and offering monthly maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 13: Interior Designing*\n",
    "\n",
    "This business is currently among the most popular real estate business ideas all across the world.

We will teach you more on how you can make money with Interior Designing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*DAY 14: Landscaping*\n",
    "\n",
    "Landscaping business or lawn care is one of the most lucrative businesses in the agro-based service industry. This green business also allows you to operate from home with small startup capital.

    "\n",
    "Tomato farming is obviously one of the most profitable horticultural activities in Kenya. This is obviously so because no Kenyan meal is considered complete without the taste of tomato. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the market is huge and ready and this is the fact that has encouraged many people to invest in large scale tomato farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone knows someone who has made millions with this crop but they also know many others who have lost terribly while at it. What makes the difference between the rich tomato farmers and those who lose their money in it is what I am about to tell you here.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Don’t farm tomatoes anywhere*\n",
    "\n",
    "Tomatoes are very easy to grow; throw a seed anywhere and a few days later you will find a nice green seedling there. This can easily deceive you into thinking that you can grow tomatoes anywhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, for you to achieve a good harvest and make money, you have to establish your farm under the optimum conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tomatoes thrive in deep well drained soils under warm or hot climate. Rainfall should be low or moderate, although the crop requires a lot of water to produce well. This is the reason why most tomato farms in Kenya are located along rivers in Narok, Kajiado, Makueni, Southern Embu, Laikipia and lower Kirinyaga. \n",
    "\n",
    "These places have the ideal high temperatures while the rivers provide the much needed water for irrigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course people at the coast would be making a kill with this crop but, unfortunately, their culture and attitude towards agribusiness stands between them and the red sweet money they would get from tomato farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Go for varieties that are high producing and disease resistant*\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific research and development has continued to bring us better tomato varieties in terms of production and disease resistance. Why would you want to stick to those varieties that give you only a handful after your long wait and hard work? \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the best open field tomato varieties that we now have in Kenya are Terminator, Big rock and Zara. Of course Anna F1 still rules the greenhouse space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you are not limited to these varieties but before you buy any seeds, ensure check the production potential and the variety’s ability to resist common tomato pests and diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Do not use ancient nursery methods to raise your tomato seedlings*\n",
    "\n",
    "I don’t know why I didn’t even start with this point. \n",
    "\n",
    "The greatest determinant of whether your tomato farming project is going to be a success or a failure is the method you use to raise your seedlings. \n",
    "\n",
    "You see that traditional way of preparing a nursery bed on the ground (fine soil, 1 meter width, grass mulch on top, etc.) I’m sorry it’s what our agriculture teachers taught us back then but the truth is that it is the source of most farmers’ loses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let me tell you why:\n",
    "\n",
    "Seedlings raised this way are exposed to soil borne diseases at that tender age. You transplant these seedlings onto your farm and they come already infected and weak. They will never give you optimum yields even if they grew to maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "When transplanting these seedlings, the roots are severely interfered with; some are even broken in the process. Therefore you end up with weak seedlings that are badly affected by transplanting shock. They take more than one week to recover and never really get to their best. Poor start is equal to poor results.\n",
    "\n",
    "So go for those seedlings that are professionally raised using modern technology. These seedlings are planted in either coco peat or peat moss. These are media that are disease-free, very light and less compact to allow for faster root development. \n",
    "\n",
    "The seedlings are raised in trays that make it easy to get the seedlings out without interfering with the roots. Such seedlings do not even suffer transplanting shock since their roots are intact. They give you the kick start you need for a good yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Ensure you do proper staking and pruning of your tomato plants*\n",
    "\n",
    "I must commend our Kenyan tomato farmers on this because I have seen most of them put efforts to stake their plants. However, it is unfortunate that most of them do it a bit too late. \n",
    "\n",
    "Staking should be done early while the seedling is still young. This helps the plant to receive maximum sunlight throughout its growth period. Also, if you do staking too late, you will find yourself trying to straighten some of the bent plants and end up breaking them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pruning is what most farmers have completely ignored, yet, it is as important as staking. We prune tomato plants to get rid of diseased branches, improve air circulation and lighting and most importantly to help the plant feed what is of importance to us – the fruits. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the tomato plant has too many side shoots and old leaves are left clinging on the stem, a lot of nutrients will be used to feed these parts yet they are not important to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Take timely action*\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the most important aspect of successful tomato farming is taking required actions early enough. Unfortunately, Kenyans will wait until their crop is heavily infested with pests before they start running from one agrovet to the other in search for the most powerful pesticide. \n",
    "\n",
    "They end up using a lot of money and saving nothing since the pest would have already done its damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worse still are the farmers who will wait for the plants to start weathering before they do the next irrigation. This takes the plants several steps backwards and significantly affects production.\n",
    "\n",
    "So do what you need to do early enough: apply that fertilizer at the right time, strike that pest before it goes through its full cycle and irrigate the plants immediately the top soil feels crumbly if you squeeze it in your hand..\n",

    "\n",
    "How did that fool overtake me? That’s the question that lingers in the minds of most people when they turn 55. \n",
    "\n",
    "They know very well that they studied hard, worked hard and lived a generally organized life. What they really can’t figure out is how that rugged looking, unschooled tout in the street managed to build an economy 100 times better than theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "How did that D- (Minus) material manage to own acres and acres of real estate? Or how did that mitumba seller manage to build a bungalow while I am still struggling to pay for a mortgaged two bedroom apartment? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that’s the sad reality of life. Sometimes those from whom not much is expected are the ones who pull a couple of surprise moves in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article brings this into perspective. It’s a life-journey comparison of two people. One is a matatu tout the other one is a banker. One is in a blue-collar worker in a field that is otherwise reserved for those who seem unambitious in life. The other one is an educated, neatly dressed white-collar professional who spends most of his time in some corner office.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only disclaimer I would like to make is that this story is not meant to demean any career. Its sole aim is to educate you on good and bad choices in life and how they influence who we become.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Matatu Tout Vs. The Banker*\n",
    "\n",
    "A matatu tout is a career despised by many owing to the fact that it is seen as a preserve for the academically weak and unintelligent people. You only need basic cash-handling skills to venture into this career which means one can get started immediately they finish form four.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a career in banking is coveted by many across the globe. In order to become a banking clerk, you need a Bachelor’s Degree or at least advanced training in accounts which obviously mean spending at least 3 years in post-secondary school.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to independent research by the SDE Kenya and Mediamax, most touts in Nairobi matatu take home averagely Ksh.1,000 to 1,500 per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a spot check on banking clerks salaries in Kenya show that most banks offer a basic salary of Ksh.30,000 to Ksh.50,000 to their employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that a matatu tout can start working almost immediately after form four and so by the time the banker finds a job, the tout already has 3 years of experience. The tout will have already completed his driving classes and just waiting for 2 more years to become a fully-fledged PSV driver. He has by default been “hardened” by rubbing shoulders with the traffic police, city council askaris and NTSA officers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let us see how the two manage their life and money differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Starting Life*\n",
    "\n",
    "The matatu tout, owing to his perceived “low class” standards is comfortable renting out a house in some dark corner of Githurai 45. That costs him a paltry Ksh.3,000 per month. Thanks to the nature of his job, he does not require to pay fare to and from town.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graduate banker on the other hand due to his perceived “high class” status in society will rent a bed-sitter in Roysambu or any other middle-income estate. That will cost him approximately Ksh.10,000 per month. Unlike the tout, he has to pay for matatu fare to and from work everyday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fare from Roysambu to town (one-way) is usually Ksh.100 during peak hours. Don’t forget the late-night Uber trips the banker has to take after a night out with his fellow educated friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How They Save*\n",
    "\n",
    "The matatu tout is naturally able to save more because of his low expenses. If he is wise and disciplined, he will join a SACCO where he will start saving with the dream of purchasing his own matatu. You will find him comfortably taking food in vibandas (temporary sheds) to save an extra coin he can find.\n",
    "\n",
    "His street survival instincts will have taught him that he can actually take advantage of free transport of his employer’s matatu to be collecting second-hand clothes in Gikomba. So he starts up a small market stall in the busy Githurai market.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the banker will be busy trying to fit into a certain lifestyle. His biggest worry will be how to upgrade from the bed-sitter in Roysambu to a one-bedroom house in Garden Estate or Ruaka. He will also be working very hard to get a loan so that he can buy a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "His goal is to particularly fit into a lifestyle worthy of a white collar job employee. You will therefore find him busy on social media updating his growing number of online fans on his daily escapades.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the matatu tout builds his savings and expands his streams of income, the banking clerk gets busy financing a lifestyle.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Five years down the line, the matatu tout has already become a PSV matatu driver which means his daily take-home has risen to between Ksh.1,500 and Ksh.2,500. He only needs to wait for a few more months and he will be having his own matatu on the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even luckier for him, he already has the hard skills of managing this tricky business. His mtumba business has also blossomed and he has left it to his wife to manage it full-time. This brings an extra Ksh.1,000 a day to the family’s kitty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The story of the banker is not all too gloom and doom either. He has already managed to clock in a few more years of experience and has been promoted to a better position. He now takes home Ksh.60,000 to Ksh.80,000 basic salary per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "He is already finishing up on repaying the car loan he took during the early years of employment. Next on his plan is to take up another loan to finance his upcoming wedding. His target budget is Ksh.1,000,000 wedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that due to his promotion at work he now has to deal with more workload… meaning his mind is fully occupied and he cannot even think of running a side-hustle.\n",

    "*At 55 Years of Age*\n",
    "\n",
    "The matatu tout has managed to grow his matatu business from one matatu to a fleet comprising 14 seaters and 33 seater HINO buses. And thanks to his experience on the road, he has been appointed as the head of his matatu sacco.\n",
    "\n",
    "His mitumba business has also grown into a fully-fledged boutique with branches in Ruai and Ongata Rongai. His wife frequently travels abroad to shop for new supplies. They have also constructed a bungalow in the outskirts of the capital. In just a few more years, they will be constructing some rental apartments in Juja.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good banker on the other hand will have reached a senior managerial position. Good for him. But that’s the end of the story. He will be stuck in debt. He has a mortgage loan for the apartment he bought in mlolongo – the mortgage loan has a repayment of 30 years meaning he will repay it until he turns 85.\n",
    "\n",
    "His kids are going to expensive schools and he is already feeling the strain of paying for tuition and boarding fee. To make matters worse, the bank he works for is not doing so well owing to factors like capped interest loan rates and entry of digital banking.\n",
    "\n",
    "A memo is circulated in the office that some people will be retrenched. He becomes a worried man. His health deteriorates. He is on the verge of having his apartment repossessed if he loses that job. \n",
    "\n",
    "He tries to secure a loan to start a business (remember he has no hands-on experience in managing his own business), it fails. You can now join the dots and figure out what happens to him in his sunset years.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",

    "Once again, the goal of this story is not to encourage you to despise some jobs. We cannot all become touts. But there is a lesson in it for all of us to learn. \n",

    "\n",
    "Airport transfer (taxi) service business is a good venture or side hustle if you have the right strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several airports in Kenya; Mombasa, Nairobi, Kisumu, Eldoret, Ukunda, Malindi and Nairobi Wilson Airport\n",
    "\n",
    "*First Things First.*\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot operate a taxi business without a vehicle. Access to a clean, functional car is the first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean you have to own it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many people including your friends or relatives with cars they do not use as such or they use it just to take them to work and back.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can enter into an arrangement with them and hire it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will soon realize, investing in your own car is the easiest part of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many people who took loans and invested in taxi business either through the hailing services and now their cars do not have jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Licensing and Insurance*\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing to worry about is licensing and insurances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airports are highly protected areas and therefore you cannot dodge the government officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Messing with airport police will cost you an arm and a leg in terms of fines and penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your car must have PSV stickers and that means you have gone to inspections as well as insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would recommend comprehensive insurance as you need to protect your guests as well as their luggage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airport transfer service is more profitable than operating in any other areas due to the nature of guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mostly will be an inbound tourist and you can charge a premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expenses like parking fees must be also factored in.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important you subscribe to the card one, as it is cheaper than to pay each time you enter the airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Marketing*\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to this fact, the competition is very stiff.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might end up not ferrying a single passenger even after two days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario has been made worse by the hailing service that charges a fraction of the fares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Airport taxis are organized in Sacco through which they negotiate for space at the airports where they will be able to easily get visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kenya Airport Authority does not allow soliciting for visitors at the airports by unlicensed drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means you will need to enroll yourselves to a registered Sacco, which will also be an initial expense.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand the operations of airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very vital to know the peak and off-peak hours at the airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is driven by the number of landings and departures taking place.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are times more than one international carriers can land almost at the same time and this means the demand will be high.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Driver*\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting a reliable driver is very crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone who is not lazy.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will realize, the business relies on the relationship and once you have offered a good service, the client will likely tell you of his travel plans during his stay in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you need someone who can pick a guest at 4:00 am and perform a drop off at 4:00 am.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also form alliances with hotels and especially receptionists and reservation agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "These know the bookings they have and therefore can advise you to go and page for a particular guest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Off course you will need to share the proceeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a presentable driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tourist will be hesitant to ride with unkempt driver and will conclude you are a thug and their safety is compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Franchise*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are registered companies that have been established in several airports. What they require is you to provide them with a vehicle and they operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be a good model since they have more guaranteed business but the returns will also be shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some require you to have your own drivers while others require you to just provide the car and they fully operate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Differentiation*\n",
    "\n",
    "As in any other business in Kenya, Competition is very stiff. Especially to starters.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it would be important for you to differentiate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key ideas to differentiate would be\n",
    "\n",
    "Airline crew transfers – this is an arrangement you have with airlines that you provide them with means to and from airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can provide more than just a transfer, say add local sim card to tourists, water, Wi-Fi, sweets etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also consider providing the customers with a digital payment method as some would not have local currency to pay you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add a meet and greet services to disabled customers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Soap is the fastest moving and the most widely used commodity in the world and particularly Kenya. Cooking oil, salt and onions follow in that order. \n",
    "\n",
    "This probably explains why most laundry soaps are made by oil refinery companies. The business goes hand in hand with cooking oil refinery since the oils we use in cooking are the same oils used in making this product with difference being the grade of the oils used for either products. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kenyan oil refinery companies usually import these oils because they have the financial muzzle to do so. It is, however, a reprieve to note that the same oils are locally produced and readily available to both small and large scale manufacturers and at relatively cheaper prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Palm oil is widely available in Mombasa, imported from Mbeya, Tanzania, while Coconut oil is abundantly pressed by many companies at Malindi, Kilifi and Changamwe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over my years in business consultancy, I have noticed one thing with almost all the people who ask for my advice concerning soap business venture: uncertainty and fear of starting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over 95% of them ask this question: Can I really succeed in this (soap making) business on such a “competitive” market? The other question that I get from these clients is this: “Does this business need/require big capital and space”?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, what I immediately conclude from these questions is fear of competition (among them) from the big players like Pwani Life, Menengai Oil Refineries, Bidco, Unilever and Kappa Oil Refinaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above mentioned companies are five among seven prominent players in soap making business in Kenya. They own leading laundry soap brands like Ushindi, Kuku, Panga, Menengai, White Star, White Wash, Sunlight, Key etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite interesting to learn that only nine (9) laundry soap brands dominate the Kenyan Market of over 52 million people. Assuming that every Kenyan bathes once at any time of the day, and does home laundry at least twice weekly, then you don’t need to be a great mathematician to guess the enormous amount of cash that Kenyans spend on only the 9 brands. \n",
    "\n",
    "This begs a valid question: Do these few 9 companies satisfy this great population with this commodity?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is yes, and no. Yes they do satisfy the demand and this is what propels them into prominence because the big local population spends billions of shillings in this valued commodity. \n",
    "\n",
    "No, because only a sizeable number of this great population of consumers buy their brands. Then whose other brands does the other members of population use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the hard truth is this: The players in this soap industry are so over-stretched that they will not disclose it. This fact is proven by the soaring prices of bar soap and occasional lack of the commodity in many local shops. \n",
    "\n",
    "The prices for soap are on upward trend because these few companies that produce them have no serious competitors thus making them appear to monopolize the trade. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the lowest priced 800 grams bar soap costs Ksh.140 in retail Supermarkets, while the most expensive bar costs Ksh.170 at the convenient stores - never mind the quality here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my research, I have established that the cost of production for one bar of 800g is Ksh.45 (by the big refining companies, while for small-to-medium firms (numbering about six in Kenya), the cost of production for a similar item is Ksh.50. \n",
    "\n",
    "These small-to-medium companies are usually family owned and supply local population (they never go beyond county level because their production capacity is too little to meet the huge local market demand). \n",
    "\n",
    "They usually source for their raw materials (mainly Oils) from retail outlets, and local factories situated at the coastal towns of Mombasa. This retail buying is what pushes their Cost of Production that “high”.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you have started noticing that making a 800g soap with ksh.50 and selling the same at Ksh.140 is a good business deal, haven’t you? \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, put it this way: Produce a 800g soap bar at a cost of Ksh.65 (packaging and market included) and give it at wholesale price of Ksh.100. Isn’t this a worthy venture?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then why isn’t everyone in this business? You might ask. \n",
    "\n",
    "People and particularly Kenyans have a poor reading culture. This leaves them with little or no room for research and knowledge, especially in a society where such business is shrouded with mystery of conspiracy, secrecy and silence. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves them in darkness when it comes to matters of business enlightenment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, many would-be manufacturers have a culture of fear or “the big-boy-syndrome”. What they do not understand is that these big companies also at one time started small. They started when there were other “big boys” in the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "To them, courage, vision and ‘risk taking’ only propelled them to where their “seniors” are. \n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, big oil refinery companies stave off competition from emerging small players by denying them access to soap making oils. Sometimes they sell crude (Acid Oil) at exorbitant prices in a bid to discourage them from manufacturing soaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of you can recall the once gigantic East African Industries - now Unilever, an even bigger giant. They once owned the world re-known Kimbo brand (now the property of BIDCO). \n",
    "\n",
    "The recent entrants such as Kappa and Pwani Life – considering where they are now - is a testimony enough that you can also be the next entrant. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is how I have been mentoring new Soap and detergent business entrepreneurs. The level of starting does not matter. Even with as little as Ksh.13,000 you can make it in soap business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ten village Kiosks at your locality are enough to propel you into unparalleled greatness. I will show you how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Science has mapped out a common trend in business: When any businesses is growing and expanding, it leaves out “accommodative loopholes” worth capitalizing on by the new emerging players. These loopholes are usually seen in customer service, pricing and taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pricing* \n",
    "\n",
    "An average customer values the price of a commodity more than quality, especially the low-to-medium income earners (who ironically constitute the biggest market). \n",
    "\n",
    "A drop in two shillings, say for a 100g bar soap, can persuade a customer to prefer the “cheaper” bar over the other-regardless the quality as long as the bar soap is lathering and foaming well. \n",
    "\n",
    "A big multinational manufacturing company with a stock value of 500,000 bars in the market, whose price is set at, say Ksh.20 per 100g bar will be losing a whooping 1 million if they decided to adjust the prices downwards with two shillings i.e. Ksh.18 per 100g bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet a small scale manufacturer whose stock value is 500 bars will not lose or gain much if he decided to adjust downward or upward the price of his bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "One million shillings for a big company is probably the salary of 100 employees (assuming they earn Ksh.10,000 each a month). \n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of adjustment (2 shillings down) must require a long-term, thorough decision by the company’s highest policy making organ whose board members will take several days of “seating’ in order to “deliberate” on the cons and pros of the price adjustment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The small-scale company won’t need much thought to “lose” 1,000 bob! It won’t be a great burden for this small-scale company.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Customer service* \n",
    "\n",
    "A small scale manufacturer can supply local Kiosks on credit to collect his money from each retailer after they sell all his soap bars. Big companies cannot do this to local kiosks, but only supermarkets.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Capital and space* \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, any amount of money can start a business, provided that the cash, commonly referred to as Business Capital, is capable of buying all the required raw material and packaging material. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a soap business, one can start with as little as Ksh.13,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Soap making oils, retailing at Ksh.90 per kilogram will consume about Ksh.9,000 (i.e. 100 kilograms of Oils capable of producing 300 killograms of soap or simply 500 bars of 600g each). \n",
    "\n",
    "Ksh.1,480 will go towards purchase of 18.5kg of Sodium Hydroxide (required to saponify 100 kilograms of Oils). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, Ksh.1,500 can make wooden Pour - Moulds of 12 bars, while Ksh.916 of the balance can purchase 41 cartons - enough to pack all the 41 dozens produced by the 500 bars. The balance of Ksh.104 can aid in movements here and there. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Space* \n",
    "\n",
    "Boiling and saponifying of the oils can be done at the fireplace of the homestead, by use of coated Aluminium pots and wooden laddle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya Bureau of Standards has no qualms over that environment of production. \n",
    "\n",
    "One professional body, Cosmetics Kenya Limited - 0723424240 has a training program for soap manufacturing and they advise their clients on how to standardize their products at home before taking a sample to KEBS.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had a chance to meet Mr. Herman of Cosmetics Kenya who is a very kind and helpful man to clients seeking advice on how to brand, market and register their products with KEBS.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Source of Raw Materials* \n",
    "\n",
    "As I said earlier, you can buy tallow locally at very cheap prices, while coconut oil can be bought from many vendors at Coastal towns of Kilifi, Malindi and Changamwe in Mombasa. \n",
    "\n",
    "Betty Industrial Chemicals, Kilifi Oil Press, among many other retailers can sell Palm Oil, Corn Oil and Coconut Oil. Blended oils are cheaper and come with different mixed ratios for different grades of soaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who wish to start with large scale production, they can source for Soap making machines from various vendors in Nairobi, among them, Express Marine Corporation Kenya, East Africa Biocutical Company, Express Machines Kenya etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Jua Kali machines which do not come with warranty or standardized Extrusion Gauges or Compression Pressure. (Compression Pressure ensures that the soap bar is of uniform weight, does not crack or does not lose quality after some time). \n",
    "\n",
    "Blended Oils for soapmaking saves a lot of money while the quality of soap is maintained. Printed Soap wrapping can be worthwhile considering but one can buy plain polythene paper roll and do screen printing at home as it saves more money.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In Conclusion* \n",
    "\n",
    "Even with as many as 1,000 soap manufacturers, they will never satisfy a population of 52 million people. You can join the existing few players and cut yourself a sizeable share of the market.\n",

    "\n",
    "Of late, Justine and I have been receiving lots of messages from our readers and the following 4 questions seem to dominate the list of inquiries.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I have saved little capital, could you please give me a good business idea that I can invest in with quick returns?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What are some of the business ideas that you would recommend to a person who has no experience as an entrepreneur?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“There are limited opportunities in the Kenyan rural areas, what type of business can I start over there?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I already have a job and I would like to start a part-time business (or side-hustle) so that I can boost my income. Can you help me?”\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does it take to identify the right kind of idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "*6 Clues That Will Give You a Business Idea*\n",
    "\n",
    "*CLUE 1: Look at Which Problems Affect Your Society*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first and easiest way to arrive at a viable business idea. Look at what problems face majority of people in your neighborhood and try to come up with a comprehensive solution and make it a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if people in your area are having to travel for long distances to re-fill their cooking gas cylinders you can pick the idea of starting a shop that supplies gas cylinders.\n",
    "\n",
    "If people are having problems accessing clean water, think of drilling a borehole and start selling them water for a small fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "If people are struggling getting quality education, and you can help, why not start a coaching business?\n",
    "\n",
    "If people are too busy in the office and have no time for lunch, why not start a food supply business?\n",
    "\n",
    "As much as the society will never lack problems you will never lack a business idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CLUE 2: Sell Your Expertise as a Service*\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone of us is an expert in one way or another. For example, while I am good at offering business advice, someone else is quite good at photography. You also have an area of expertise as well – may be you are a good cook or you are an excellent sportsman.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are good at playing the guitar why not think of starting a guitar school and start offering guitar lessons for a fee?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are good at social media why not start building your social media consultancy business today?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are good at offering fashion advice why not start a fashion blog?\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of starting a business at an area you are an expert in is that you can easily beat the competition so long as you offer quality services to your clients. Of course, such a business might be difficult to start but with patience, dedication and quality services; there’s no room for failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CLUE 3: Convert Your Passion or Talent into a Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "We all have our unique passions and talents. You have your talent or special ability that you can transform into a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn’t matter how strange your talent or passion is, provided you have the guts to market it out there you can rest assured of getting a customer or two.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there is this young man who walks around Nairobi carrying a big drum on his shoulders. He calls himself “The One Man Band” because he plays all of his 12 instruments by himself. While that is a somewhat strange talent, he still makes a living from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how different is this man from you? The only difference is that he is bold enough and does not shy off from marketing his talent.\n",
    "\n",

    "What makes Mark Zuckenberg (the man behind Facebook) and Bill Gates (the man behind Microsoft) so different from the rest of us? These two men created unique products that changed the world for good.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a product that will change the world for good – and you don’t need to be a scientist to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could start making unique bracelets and jewelries. You can as well write a book and sell it. You can record a good video of yourself and sell it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a good fashion designer, you can create a unique shirt say with Kenyan colors and sell.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is definitely the oldest form of marketing and advertising used by businesses since the world began. While it may bring slower results than radio or television, it still works very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because people are becoming increasingly suspicious of some adverts, as some adverts can be scamming, I still think word-of-mouth remains one of the most trusted methods in the world today.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a customer is happy and satisfied with a product or service, there’s a natural human tendency that they are likely to share this experience with people in their circle of trust and influence – family, friends, colleagues, neighbours and sometimes, strangers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A satisfied customer is one of the most effective marketing and advertising tools a small business can ever have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Satisfied customers become foot soldiers, evangelists and advocates for your business. It is amazing how many of your satisfied customers will go to great lengths to promote, convince, protect and defend your business outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word-of-mouth is so effective and powerful that many successful businesses rely solely on this method to advertise and market their products and services. Network marketing businesses are a good example.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how exactly can your small business grow an army of passionate customers who will use word-of-mouth advertising to your advantage?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I have a couple of ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most important step is to:- \n",
    "\n",
    "*Sell a product or service that really works and provides great value to anybody who uses them.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If a product or service delivers on its promise and does more than what it says, it’s a winner!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people buy products or services to solve a problem or satisfy a need. Nothing will make a customer happier and more satisfied than getting a product that makes a very challenging problem go away. They’ll scream your name from the mountain tops!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Great customer experience.*\n",
    " \n",
    "Most times, it doesn’t really matter how large or deep-pocketed your competition is. You can grow a successful business on great customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "People like to buy products and services from businesses that treat them with respect. People love to be given attention and treated well and will always return to enjoy that beautiful experience again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t forget, customers spend their hard-earned money on your products. Don’t you think they deserve a big “Thank you\" with a wide smile on your face? People hardly forget a great customer experience and will happily tell other people about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Give your customers a reason to advertise and market your business.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, word-of-mouth advertising doesn’t come automatically; you have to encourage, motivate or incentivize your customers to do it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start a referral or reward program for your existing customers. The more people they refer to you, the more free products, services and discounts they will enjoy. The reward should be large enough to trigger their interest and make them take action. It’s a win-win method that always works.\n",
    "\n",
    "I once helped a friend of mine create a loyalty and referral program for her barbershop and beauty salon business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way it works is simple. All existing customers were registered and given a unique code. Whenever they spend money in the shop, it increases the total amount they have spent to date. If this total reaches a certain level, they are awarded certain discounts for all the services they pay for.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were four levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum) with increasing rewards. The results were amazing! Almost every customer was referring their family, friends, neighbours and total strangers to the salon to spend money under their code thereby increasing their totals and making them reach the Gold and Platinum levels faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the power of word of mouth. Make use of it and watch your business grow.\n",

    "\n",
    "Maina Macharia and his mother Teresa Macharia from Chorogi village, Nyeri County own an exotic birds project worth millions. The duo have at least 50 different species of exotic birds in various stages of growth, which they sell to high end customers and resorts. They include turkey, Egyptian geese and guinea fowls e.t.c.\n",
    "\n",
    "Teresa recalls how they started the birds project: “Four years ago, my son who was then working in Mombasa, sent me a small package. Inside was a pair of live guinea fowl. When I asked him what these birds are for, he just told me to rear them like chicken. I did just that.”\n",
    "\n",
    "For Maina, this was just another boyish hobby — collecting beautiful birds and sending them to his mother.\n",
    "\n",
    "His mission was just to have a series of beautiful birds dotting their rural farm. But as time progressed, Maina felt like poultry business could be lucrative. As he sought what else to do, he stumbled on the idea of keeping game birds as a commercial venture.\n",
    "\n",
    "To roll off the project, Maina got a license from the Kenya Wildlife Service to keep the game birds at the farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Next, I went online and ordered 300 eggs of California geese from the US, which we incubated and hatched,” Maina says. And that is how the exotic bird business was hatched.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We sell our exotic birds in pairs, male and female therefore we sell each pair at Sh.8,000. The returns are encouraging because the running costs are minimal and the birds mature fast,” Maina says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maina says rearing exotic birds is one of the best decisions he has ever made. Why? He says exotic bird farming is lucrative, the returns are high and the investment low.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The beauty of these birds is that they have low maintenance. They eat feeds that a kienyeji chicken eat like sukuma wiki and maize meal. They also do not fall ill often,” Maina says adding, “I breed the birds on an eighth of an acre which is quite small considering the returns. I also focus on pure breeds of chicken such as booted bantum, silky, pekin, kuchi, and black oripington which often have high yields.”\n",
    "\n",
    "And the winning score is that, demand for the rare birds is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "“My clientele is high end, people who have everything in life and they just want beautiful creatures to colour their farms. I also have a solid client base from posh resorts in the Rift Valley,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the biggest challenge is sourcing for the pure breed of the exotic birds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crossbreeding of various game birds has made it difficult to acquire pure breeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I have to travel around the country and sometimes to other East African countries to ensure I have enough exotic birds to sell my clients,” Maina says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maina has traveled to Somalia and Uganda where he sources for the Vulturine guinea fowl and Crown bird respectively. So far he has several species of guinea fowls such as Vulturine, which is the largest species of guinea fowl. He also keeps Royal Blue from Taita Taveta, White fowls, spotted fowls and Spur fowls.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We have eggs, chicks and grown birds of geese, duck, turkeys, pigeons, chicken, so we can easily breed the birds the clients want,” Mrs Macharia says. One of the unique challenges for the exotic bird farmer is that the wild birds often spread diseases to domesticated birds.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Most water fowl such as ducks and geese are disease carriers which mean when they come in contact with domesticated chicken they transmit communicable illnesses which can wipe out entire flocks. So we are careful not to mix the two,” Mrs Macharia says. The game birds also do not reproduce well in captivity therefore breeding the birds is a slow and often unproductive process.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Exotic birds require their natural habitat so that they can lay eggs and reproduce naturally. However, living in caged environments stresses them which slows down their reproductive systems,” Maina says.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of this business is that clients are tempted to buy the birds just by beholding their beauty.\n",
    "\n",
    "“When an exotic bird customer visits the farm, they may have come for a pair of geese but when they see the other beautiful breeds, they take them too. The sight of the birds is so beautiful the farmers are always tempted to take more.”\n",
    "\n",
    "On average the Macharias earn Sh.15,000 a day from the sale of birds, which easily translates to Sh.450,000 per month on a good month. Interestingly, the most lucrative of the birds being the vulturine which can fetch as much as Sh.40,000 per pair..\n",

    "\n",
    "6 years ago, a friend was describing to me how distraught she was as her mother had plans to buy a car. I was utterly surprised as everyone’s script of making it, involves a car in the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Imagine my mum wants to buy a Probox of all cars. Afadhali tukae bila gari!”\n",
    "\n",
    "She might have expected me to join her in the apparent sorrow as I was her then best friend. Instead, I was silently listening as she kept narrating this and that. \n",
    " \n",
    "The best thing about the Probox is it is affordably Cheap! They come in various colours from white (very common), gray, navy blue, extra black and yellow too!\n",
    "\n",
    "A few years back, the Pope himself was scheduled to ride in a purple Probox while in Kenya as it had a sense of humility to it. Whether he eventually did or not is a story for another day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toyota Probox has become one of the most used cars in most parts of Africa, with Kenya leading with the number of individuals importing the small car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the Toyota Probox was meant for individuals who wanted to transport luggage, besides enjoying the comfort of the vehicle, but people realized that the car can do so many things other cars won’t manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "People who own Toyota Probox have absolutely zero regrets - they state that the car is thrice as good as other small cars. One of the major reasons why people love the vehicle is that despite being a small car, it can carry heavy goods, a big family, and also manage to cover the distance other cars won’t manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The car can also be used to ferry passengers as normal matatu or be used as a TAXI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toyota Probox has also been voted as one of the best in fuel consumption. You can cover over 300 kilometers and only spend less than Ksh.3,000\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, individuals own the car for 12 years, meaning that it is very durable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To own a new Toyota Probox, you need less than Ksh.900,000, which means the car is extremely cheap. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ways Kenyans use the Probox far from its manufactured purpose when exported:\n",

    "\n",
    "*5. Selling electronics.*\n",

    "\n",
    "We have all heard of the most recent baby on the social media block, TikTok. The app came into the market in 2016 and is known for its fun content such as dances, lip-sync, and comedy but has a lot of informative content too.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You might have used the app yourself or interacted with its content on other social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, you name it. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, apart from having fun and laughter on the app, have you ever thought of what it would do for your small business? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if you have not, you need to think about it, and here is why. According to data, TikTok is the fastest growing social media app in the market right now. The app has over 2.6 Billion downloads with 1 billion active users every month. \n",
    "\n",
    "The app is mostly used by Generation Z but is rapidly spreading to the rest of the population and you can only imagine how big the app would get with time. \n",
    "\n",
    "More and more businesses, from big to small are finding their way to TikTok and taking advantage of the marketing opportunity. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Using TikTok for business*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are considering using TikTok to promote your business, opening an account for your business is the first thing you need to do. With TikTok, people want authenticity and fun, and anything that looks like a hard-selling advert does not do well on TikTok. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way is to check what other businesses are doing on TikTok and how they are ‘selling’ their brand. You can do that by simply searching for businesses you know for example from Instagram and seeing what they do. \n",
    "\n",
    "What content are they creating? How are they interacting with people on the platform? \n",
    "\n",
    "*Promoting your small business*\n",
    "\n",
    "With TikTok, you can create or upload and edit short videos in the app accompanied by music. \n",
    "\n",
    "TikTok allows you to create either a personal account or a business account. The business account is a little more limiting in terms of the music you can use in your video. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bio, tell people what your business is all about and share your contacts – Email, phone number, Instagram Business page, or any other means they can use to find you or your products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Instagram, TikTok does not have a shop option but you can do the following on the app to push your brand, your goods, or services. \n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Create and Share Fun and Engaging Content*\n",
    "\n",
    "As you create your content, be authentic, creative and make sure it’s fun and engaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show yourself (the face behind the business), if you have a team, show your team. Bring people to experience your business by showing your business process in a fun, humorous way. This could be a video showing how you create your products, how you package your products or just daily fun activities in your ‘office’. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a nail salon, for example, show the process of getting someone’s nails done with fun music in the background. Another idea would be, nail inspiration – showing types of nail work one can get done, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a clothes business, you could choose to create outfit inspiration content using your pieces. \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating your own original content for your channel is a great way to grow your channel and reach your target audience without spending. \n",
    "\n",
    "*2. User-Generated Content*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is among the surest ways of promoting your business. Share videos of people using your products or experiencing your services. If someone is using your product, ask them to tag you in any video they share that has your products in it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another great USG content would be resharing those videos to your page. \n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Hashtags*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a no-brainer, we all know social media goes hand in hand with hashtags. On TikTok, come up with a hashtag for your business and use it in all your videos. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your bakery is Nel Bakes, you could come up with a simple hashtag that identifies with your business such as #NelBakes. You can use other hashtags related to your brand and your business industry. Disclaimer, don’t use too many hashtags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use popular and general hashtags, that way your content has a higher chance to be seen by a larger audience. However, make sure you balance between popular and general hashtags and specific and less popular hashtags. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specific and less popular hashtags help you reach your target audience but the potential number of people you will reach is smaller. Just make sure you combine and balance the hashtags.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to User Generated Content, ask your customers to use your hashtag when they are sharing a video displaying your products. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hashtags are a great way to build your audience on TikTok.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Jump into trends*\n",
    "\n",
    "TikTok has a discovery page feature that shows you all the trending sounds, hashtags and challenges. This will give you inspiration for videos that you can adapt for your business. Jumping on these trends as early as possible will make it easy for you to reach people. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, do not jump into all trends, only adapt to trends that can help reflect what your small business is all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Collaborate with TikTok Infuencers*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the business world we are in right now, influencer marketing has become a great deal. Big brands recognize that and are using influencers, both macro, and micro to push their brands and their products. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way, how many times have you bought a product or used a service you were introduced to by an influencer? If it is more than once, that shows that influencer marketing works. \n",
    "\n",
    "When looking for influencers, consider the numbers these TikTok content creators have. They do not have to be crazy numbers but how is their engagement with their audience? Their engagement is what sells. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider getting influencers who are in line with your business. Can they actually use and love your products or services? Can they speak and sell your products or services? \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are a beauty business, look for people or someone who is passionate about promoting beauty products. In this scenario, it would be a great fit to use someone who creates beauty content and people can trust them with whatever they have to say about a beauty product or a beauty service. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Advertising on TikTok?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Instagram has Instagram Ads, Facebook has Facebook Ads and Google has Google Ads. Does TikTok have TikTok Ads? \n",
    "\n",
    "It does have TikTok Ads but the TikTok Ads Manager feature is not available in Africa yet, apart from South Africa. \n",
    "\n",
    "TikTok Ads Manager in the other regions operates just like Facebook Ads Manager. You can easily choose your goal, select your audience, set your budget, design your Ad and easily measure your ads performance. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "How much money do businesses at Thika Road Mall really make? \n",
    "\n",
    "I have been to Thika Road Mall a couple of times since its inception. Initially, I frequented the massive shopping complex due to a lack of options. But I came to learn that it is indeed a cool place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the brands that have graced the mall currently and previously include LC Waikiki, Carrefour, Aladdin, Burger King, Pizza Inn, Mini Sou, NCBA, Cooperative Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Safaricom, Java House, Mater Hospital, Diamond Trust Bank, Gertrude’s Hospital, Nikon, Samsung, Saaple, Classic Forex Bureau.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thika Road Mall, popularly known as TRM, was the first major mall to be built along the superhighway. Things stayed that way for months but later on Garden City Mall and others emerged to level up the playing field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever I set foot at the Roysambu-based mall, my main agenda always revolves around sipping beverages at the coffee shops or engaging in two-person meetings. It never hurts to take a stroll around the place too once I am done doing whatever took me there. I do this in order to make observations and maybe come up with something interesting to write about.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I have noticed is that most of the people who go to TRM are not actually buyers but window shoppers. They don’t go there to break the bank, their goal is simply site-seeing. That’s right. A good portion of the daily population in this business hub consists of passersby who treat it like a museum or monument, not a shopping paradise.\n",
    "\n",
    "What seems to be the problem then? Are the people mean? Not really. \n",
    "\n",
    "Are costs of goods and services beyond reach? Is the location of the mall an issue?\n",
    "\n",
    "I would go for the latter. My personal opinion is that businesses located at TRM should be those that cater for middle-class people because such are the people that live close by. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem seems to be that TRM is filled with goods and services that that only people in posh estates would afford yet it’s surrounded by estates such as Roysambu, Githurai, Kahawa West and the likes. \n",
    "\n",
    "A person living in Gigiri would definitely not come all the way to TRM to buy that 72-inch TV on display. Neither will the person in Githurai.\n",
    "\n",
    "I once walked into a jewellery shop at the mall to check out some watches and the lady in charge was looking at people with that tough stare that speaks a thousand words. \n",
    "\n",
    "That stare that stays “I know you fellas aren’t going to buy, just hurry and get out of here, please. I know you can’t afford these expensive things”\n",
    "\n",
    "So the big question is, if there are so many window shoppers, do the businesses make any money? \n",
    "\n",
    "Unless we check their records, it’s hard to tell. I bet some stalls make a couple of shillings but not as much as they would love to. Given the high number of window shoppers, there is minimal probability that the revenue accrued is admirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important lessons I was taught in economics class was ‘location consideration’ when setting up a business. Take a close look at the community around where you would like to be based. \n",
    "\n",
    "Does a sufficient percentage of that population match your customer profile to support your business and provide adequate demand? \n",
    "\n",
    "Does the community have a stable economic base that will provide a healthy environment for your business?\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess this is something that was ignored by either the shops that operate at the mall or the management of the mall itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article should be a lesson to all of us. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can locate your business anywhere you want and set any prices you want, but if your target customers cannot afford your products or services, your business won’t sell anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why it’s always a good strategy to analyse your market and study your potential customers when you are deciding your location and setting prices for your products or services.\n",

    "\n",
    "We get this question all the time, especially from people who want to stock their businesses with fast moving goods from the USA to Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the hottest products people ship from the USA to Kenya?\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought it is a good idea to compile a list of the commonest shipped goods from the USA to East Africa (Kenya, Uganda, Ruanda & Tanzania)\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you guess which products are shipped the most from the USA to Kenya?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I get on to the list, let me start by mentioning the reason why people trust American brands. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Reason why some people prefer getting their Goods from USA*\n",
    "\n",
    "*A. Avoiding Fake Products*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is no secret that we are sick and tired of counterfeit goods from China, all over Africa. Almost everyone in Kenya has bought something fake, knowingly or unknowingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever bought a fake product knowingly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people buy fake products with an intent to save money - getting a deal and ignoring the fact that they could be buying knock-off products.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes you think a brand new Nike sneaker being sold for Ksh.800 is an original while Nike.com sells the same shoe for $80 (Ksh.8,000)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, our list of the most shipped products from the USA to Kenya seems to avoid the risk of buying fake products in the streets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me ask ladies a question (If you wear makeup like LAGirl, Black Opal, MAC, etc. this is for you...)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you see LA Girl cosmetics being sold on Facebook for 650 shillings and you think you have found a deal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever thought about checking out how much LA girl website sells their products for?  That would make you know if you are getting a Makeup or Fakeup!\n",
    "\n",
    "If LA girl, for example, the manufacturer of these cosmetics sells them for $10, the equivalent of Ksh.1,100, what makes you think that buying them at half price is a deal? Could you be buying a cancer-causing fakeup from China?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the manufacturer is selling the same product you are buying for Ksh.650 ($6.25) at $10, how lucky do you think you are?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the person selling you the Fakeup at Ksh.650 is making a profit, how much do you think they bought it for, from whichever source?  You can tell, they did not get it from LA Girl manufacturer. The rest is up to you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you see why most people BUY FAKE products knowingly, else, ignorant? \n",
    "\n",
    "*B. USA Goods Are of Better Quality*\n",
    "\n",
    "A few years ago, somewhere along Muindi Bingu street in Nairobi, I needed to get a shirt for an upcoming event I had. I always prefer buying crease-free shirts and Ralph Lauren brand is one of the leaders in wrinkle-free shirts. These shirts do not require ironing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I entered into one of the shops there to get a Ralph Lauren shirt which costed me Ksh.10,500. Given the location of the store I bought it from and the cost, I was confident I bought an authentic shirt. Everything checked out.\n",
    "\n",
    "I took the shirt with me and I was shining like a new dime during the event. The shirt was perfect for the event I had but I needed to get it laundered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember this was a crease-free shirt and water machine washable. The laundry machine washed the shirt per manufacturer instructions. It wasn't the first time to wear a Ralph Lauren shirt either.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I got the shirt out of the dryer, the shirt that was fitting me was less than half my size and had creases I have never seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Needless to say more, I only wore a Ksh.10,500 shirt once. This time, the location of the store and the price fooled me to believe I was getting an authentic shirt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we are talking about the quality of the shirt or if it was fake, I regretted my painful purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "*C. Products Are Cheaper in USA Than You Think*\n",
    "\n",
    "I just talked about buying a Ralph Lauren shirt in Nairobi for Ksh.10,500. If you go to RalphLauren.com website, wrinkle-free shirts are not that expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The price I paid for a fake shirt would have gotten me 3 shirts from RalphLauren.com and have enough to ship from the USA to Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a rip-Off!\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you think you have ever bought a fake product?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the point, for you to buy an authentic item with no doubts of buying knock0off or counterfeit, Buy straight from the source. Example, Bathandbodyworks.com, Ralphlauren.com Nike.com - etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Most Shopped & Shipped Products from USA to Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Cosmetics & Makeup!*\n",
    "\n",
    "The moment a woman learns that she can get her cosmetics from the source, she can only buy more. I just shared a perfect example of questionable fakeup being sold on Facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "I bet any lady reading this will from here henceforth buy original cosmetics straight from the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am sure this is going to make you think otherwise about cosmetics sold in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever seen a store that calls itself BATH & BODYWORKS?\n",
    "\n",
    "If so, does it make you believe you are buying from Bath & Bodyworks authentic store?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bath & Body Works have no franchises or distributors anywhere in the world. You either buy straight from them or risk buying fake products. Bath and Body Works is owned by Victoria Secrets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are hundreds of honest businesswomen and men shopping cosmetics straight from the source and reselling in Kenya for a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have created a tribe of loyal customers because they always deliver the original/authentic product. \n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Unlocked Phones*\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone wants to have a good phone with long battery life and still get a great deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every year, brands like Apple & Samsung releases a new version of their phones. This has been the case since the invention of smartphones by Steve Jobs in June 2007.\n",
    "\n",
    "Americans are spenders, no wonder American brands like Apple are worth more than all East African countries Combined because they feed big spenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Americans use a phone for only one year and trade it in for the latest model. That means every year, there are millions and millions of secondhand phones that get in the unlocked phones market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best source of unlocked phones is a website called Swappa, not eBay or Amazon. Why Swappa? They verify IMEI number to make sure the phone is authentic, it is unlocked and has not been reported lost or stolen.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side, eBay is the king of fake phones, lost and stolen. If you must buy a phone from eBay, treat with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. DJ Equipment & Sound Systems*\n",
    "\n",
    "This never ceases to amaze me.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many DJs do we have in Kenya? It seems like DJ equipment and home sound systems have a huge demand, especially Numark & Pioneer DJ equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know a set also comes with a powerful MacBook - Right?\n",
    "\n",
    "I once talked to one of the DJs in Kenya and he told me that he has a DJ training program where he trains DJs, equips them and helps them to get placements.\n",
    "\n",
    "He has helped hundreds of them. You should get to know DJ Sam Omol and his talent.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Baby Clothes & Toys*\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes a lot of sense. The cost of baby clothes from China in Kenya is prohibitive. Kids clothes and shoes are fast moving items because they outgrow them a few months after you buy them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see a lot of parents opting to buy baby clothes in sets from the USA, not sure how much they cost locally. A good set of premium brand baby clothes costs around $25 - $35 in the USA\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Electronics*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a surprise. Electronics like laptops, cameras, and tablets are some of the most sought after items in the USA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, we see more cameras than we see laptops and iPads. Of course, the cost of a good camera in Kenya is prohibitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the USA, cameras, just like phones are released in a serial version with every new version coming with newer, better and superior features.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally,*\n",

    "“Chase your dreams and money will chase you. Don’t do a course because of money, do it because it’s what you love to do.”\n",
    "\n",
    "You have probably heard this advice from somewhere before, that you should focus on what you are passionate about and money will follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lydia is a living example of the truth to this statement. She discovered from the young age of 12 years old that she had an interest in beauty. She nurtured that passion, through the highs and lows, up to where she is now. Today, Lydia owns a successful spa in Parklands that focuses on skin technology, makeup, nails, and other beauty services and products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things were not always easy for Lydia. Her journey, as you will see, has been a rollercoaster. However, she was guided by her love for the industry and focus on what her heart desired until she finally made a breakthrough. From earning 3,500 shillings a month, Lydia now makes this amount in just one hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "We sat down with Lydia to find out more about her journey to where she is today, to draw some advice for upcoming beauticians, and to learn from the lessons that she has learnt in this journey.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Who is Lydia?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a child of God who loves Jesus, a beauty therapist, a skin specialist, and an entrepreneur. I am the CEO of Flawless by Lydia. I am 30 years old and the firstborn of a family of 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Take us through your journey from the beginning up to now.*\n",
    "\n",
    "I grew up in Machakos County. When I was in class 6, at age 12, I discovered that I loved braiding hair. I joined a mixed secondary school and did my KCSE in 2011. All along, I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life. I saw excellence in my gift and passion rather than studying at university. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was that my parents didn’t support my idea of joining a Beauty College at first. I found a job as a house help in Nairobi and my monthly salary was 3,500 Kenyan shillings. I worked as a house help for 2 years and then I decided to try out something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, I went to Kamukunji downtown to sell baby clothes. This is when I realized that God was calling me to the business industry. In 2015, my parents agreed to pay my college fees at Ashley’s Hair and Beauty Academy. The course was to take 7 months, but I did it in 5 months. I was so good at it that my teacher found me a job in Westlands. \n",
    "\n",
    "God blessed me with a great boss who is still my mentor in the beauty industry. She advised me to learn more about skin technology and so I took an international level course for 3 months. I later graduated as the best student at Ashley’s, worked for one and a half years, then opened my first company Heavenly Joy spa. \n",
    "\n",
    "My main issue was starting capital, and so I decided to work with a business partner. The spa was in operation for 8 months then we shut down. I left everything and started another business on my own. So Flawless by Lydia spa was born in 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You said that from the beginning you weren’t interested in joining the university, but that was against your parents’ will. How did you manage to change their minds to the point where they paid for your fees at Ashley’s?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, it’s not me who changed their minds, they did. They realized that I was not ready to give up on my dream. In fact, they didn’t know the college and yet they paid my whole school fees at a go.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What advice would you give to parents who put their vision before their children’s desires?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspire your children to follow their dreams, rather than your dreams for them. Motivate their talents whether it is playing football, cooking, dancing, fashion, beauty, or any other. It’s not your plan as a parent but God’s plan for them. Your work is to pray, support, and encourage them because it’s not easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Who/What inspires you?*\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, I inspire myself. When I look back to where I have come from it gives me hope for tomorrow. My clients also believing in me and supporting me is an inspiration. I love beauty and this is where my purpose is. Knowing this drives me with a passion to make it happen. This is God’s gift to me and what I do is my gift back to God.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What would you say is the main challenge in this industry?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest challenge in the industry is the increase in the production of fake products that sometimes have a bleaching effect. Secondly, there is a lot of unprofessionalism in this industry. Many people who call themselves beauty therapists are unqualified and this might have effects on the client’s health in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your biggest achievement?*\n",
    "\n",
    "For starters, I was the best student of the year 2015 at Ashley’s Hair and Beauty Academy. I have advanced in my beauty career and become a skin specialist. Lastly, being a CEO of Flawless by Lydia spa and creating Employment for young people is among my biggest accomplishments. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Recently, there has been a lot of controversy when it comes to the issue of using makeup. There have been instances where people are bashed online for not looking the same when they’re without makeup. What is your take on the perception that makeup is for ugly girls trying to hide their flaws?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I don’t believe that any of this is true. I believe that no matter your flaws make up only boosts your features by enhancing them, but at the same time, it doesn’t make you who you are. I’m a strong believer that inner beauty matters. I am blessed to have gone through a lot and my story shows that if you work on your personality first the rest will follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is it possible to maintain good skin on a low budget? Why or why not? If yes, how do you do so?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it’s possible. You start by knowing your skin type and skin condition for you to get the right products. I would advise you to first consult a skin specialist who will help you understand your skin and help you work on your budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What would you tell the younger you?*\n",
    "\n",
    "To be purpose-driven and patient. Everything will work out in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Where do you see yourself in ten years?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ten years from now, I will have set up branches for the Flawless Spa. I would also like to open up a beauty school where I will hold beauty training and especially in skin technology. I would like to see boys and girls achieve their dreams just like I have in this industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What advice would you give to young girls trying to penetrate the industry?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say that purpose drives you into doing what you love. Chase your dreams and money will chase you. Don’t do a course because of money, do it because it’s what you love to do. I used to earn 3,500 shillings a month. Now I earn that in less than an hour.\n",

    "Would you like to invest in stocks? The stock market is a crucial financial institution that lets investors (including you and me) to own shares of big companies and make some profit out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, there are two main ways to make money from stocks.\n",
    " \n",
    "The first method is through dividends that are dished out to shareholders after the company they have bought shares from makes profit. For instance, in 2008 Safaricom went public and offered every person an opportunity to own a piece of it. Each share was then priced at Ksh.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say Mr. Juma bought stocks worth Ksh.10,000 at that time. So technically Mr. Juma became an owner of Safaricom — and as you know when you become a business owner, you are entitled to a share of its profit at the end of each financial year. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second method is through buying the shares and waiting for them to gain value and then re-selling them.\n",
    " \n",
    "For instance, you can buy 1,000 shares from Company ABCD at Ksh.10 per share (You will spend Ksh.10,000). Then wait for Company ABCD shares to gain value say to Ksh.15 and then you sell them. This way, your Ksh.10,000 will grow to Ksh.15,000 thus making a profit of Ksh.5,000.\n",

    "25/01/2022, 9:49 am - +254 742 304047: *STOCK TRADING TIPS AND HOW YOU CAN GET STARTED IN 2022*\n",
    "\n",
    "The stock market is a crucial financial institution that lets investors (including you and me) to own shares of big companies and make some profit out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making money on the stock market however requires you to be armed with the right kind of information. Keep scrolling downwards to learn more about the art of share trading.\n",
    " \n",
    "You can trade stocks by buying shares from companies that have been listed under the Nairobi Securities Exchange. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, there are two main ways to make money from stocks.\n",
    " \n",
    "The first method is through dividends that are dished out to shareholders after the company they have bought shares from makes profit. For instance, in 2008 Safaricom went public and offered every person an opportunity to own a piece of it. Each share was then priced at Ksh.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say Mr. Juma bought stocks worth Ksh.10,000 at that time. So technically Mr. Juma became an owner of Safaricom — and as you know when you become a business owner, you are entitled to a share of its profit at the end of each financial year. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second method is through buying the shares and waiting for them to gain value and then re-selling them.\n",
    " \n",
    "For instance, you can buy 1,000 shares from Company ABCD at Ksh.10 per share (You will spend Ksh.10,000). Now you wait for Company ABCD shares to gain value say to Ksh.15 and then you re-sell them. This way, your Ksh.10,000 will grow to Ksh.15,000 thus making a profit of Ksh.5,000.\n",
    " \n",
    "Stocks are bought through stock brokers. These brokers often charge a small commission for each transaction. It is important to choose a genuine and reputable broker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stocks tend to pay more particularly if you invest in a profitable company. But timing is key. If you buy stocks from a growing company then you can only hope for good returns. If the company you have invested in makes losses and declares bankruptcy then you may not get any returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you bought Mumias stocks while they were priced at Ksh.15 and today they are selling at Ksh.3 then your returns may not be anything worth talking about. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand you can hold on, and if the company resurrects, the share prices will rise and all will be well. That's what happened to Safaricom in 2007. Their share prices went down but later after the post election violence their shares went up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making money in the stock market however requires you to be armed with the right kind of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called, *INVESTING IN STOCKS TRAINING*\n",

    "\n",
    "When I was growing up, I suddenly fell in love with two things.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I loved (and still love) setting goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I loved (and still love) listening to people I wish to be like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I am grown up, really? (At least, I am no longer a boy.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people remain the same because they don’t do these two things; set goals and listen to people who have achieved what they want to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will not talk much about setting goals today because it’s easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me talk about who to listen to.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, there is too much noise in the world and unfortunately, almost everyone has an advice for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you were young, your father had advice for you, your mother, your sister, your brother, even your uncle had an advice for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are grown up, TV, Movies, Media, interviewees, your lecturers, political leaders and everyone else in-between has an advice for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is, unlike when you are young, the advice people give you when you are an adult mostly gets registered in your mind unconsciously.\n",
    "\n",
    "And you know something?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most advice are bad advice\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is the way out?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple, change who you listen to.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change your life, change who you listen to.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you know who to listen to?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple; Identify those people who have achieved what you want to achieve and listen to them ONLY.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I was growing up, I knew I wanted to become an entrepreneur as an adult.\n",
    "\n",
    "I knew I wanted to build a company, employ people, make money etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also knew that I wanted to become a good Christian and … (something else I won’t tell you today)\n",
    "\n",
    "I would then go to bookstores and buy books writing by people who have achieved what I wanted to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also go to the cyber cafe to read from the likes of Anthony Robbins, Brian Tracy, Robert Kiyosaki, etc. (internet wasn’t common back then).\n",
    "\n",
    "I love it when these authors tell me the stories of people who have achieved greatness with their lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would tell myself, “If these ones did it, I can do it”\n",
    "\n",
    "I later fell in love with the books by Herb Cohen, Brain Sher, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I discovered is that;\n",
    "\n",
    "The advice these people gave me was in absolute contradiction with the advice my father, uncle or anyone I knew in the physical world would give me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The media, TV, movies, etc. too never gave me the right advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can guess, I immediately earned a name as “stubborn and proud boy who doesn’t listen to advice”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me stop telling you my story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me confront you with the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as you keep on listen to what you read in the news (that economy is bad, that Africa is poor etc.), as long as you continue believing what movies and social media has to tell you, you have wrong advisers.\n",
    "\n",
    "People eventually end up being like their advisers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If (for example) you want to be a successful entrepreneur and your father or lecturer never sold water, well, I am sorry, you don’t have to listen to your lecturer or father’s advice (about money).\n",
    "\n",
    "People will call you “arrogant” but it’s ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to be an athlete and your sister has never ran a mile, well, don’t ever try to listen to her about running.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to succeed in life (as a rule), you must learn how to neglect the “facts” and woes in the news, movies and TV.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you wake up in the morning, after your necessary spiritual devotion, make sure the next thing you do is to listen to someone who has achieved what you wish to achieve or someone who will tell you about him/her.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by reading a book, watching a YouTube video or listening to an audio book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop listening to negative people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop listening to people who have not done what you wish to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let them call you “arrogant” if they like, don’t take advice from people who want you to believe the economy is bad or that you can’t go far.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you forget everything in this long Epistle, don’t forget;\n",
    "\n",
    "You will end up just like your advisers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Maybe you must have found yourself in a situation where you urgently needed money in the form of a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "At that moment, you could not go to your bank because maybe you have an existing loan, had defaulted on a loan, and on an extreme case, had been listed on CRB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having been listed on CRB meant that you could also not contact any other financial institution, leave alone your bank, for any loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mobile lenders and Apps could also not assist because you are still listed on CRB.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is a situation most Kenyans find themselves in when they need loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the only way you can overcome this financial need is to have someone willing to lend you money without considering your credit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because let’s face it, if no financial institution is willing to lend you money in Kenya, who can?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course a shylock!\n",
    "\n",
    "You will however need collateral like maybe your TV, fridge, or microwave… anything that has monetary value to get these loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what is called Private Lending Business.\n",
    "\n",
    "This business has thrived in Kenya that it is now among the most profitable businesses in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a large sum of money lying in your bank as deposits, you can start a Private Lending Business and gain interest from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to Start a Private Lending Business in Kenya (Location).*\n",
    "\n",
    "The most pressing financial needs which may require the intervention of Private Lenders are not back at the rural areas but in urban areas. Your Private Lending Business will thrive better in the city or an urban setting than the rural areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Private Lending Business (Requirements).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here comes things that are mandatory for success in the Private Lending Business:-\n",
    "\n",
    "*Identify the need for private lending*\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t just go ahead lending money to people who might as well not have needed your intervention. This is business and you need to first identify an exploitable gap. People will always have financial needs anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Register your Business* \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to register your micro-lending company with the appropriate agency. You will also need to obtain all the necessary licenses and permits. And most importantly, you must fulfil legal obligations required by your county government to avoid falling into problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Draft contract forms*\n",
    "\n",
    "Signed contracts are very recognizable by the law. You only need the person you are lending money to sign a contract form and you can sue them in a court of law incase of anything (which rarely happens if you have collateral) and you will still be safe, not unless it is found out that you forged a document for fraud. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not forge signatures – let your clients sign the contract forms themselves. Contract forms are the only thing that makes the agreement between you and the borrower binding and legal.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Determine interest rates and the maximum amount you can lend*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to determine how much you will charge on your borrowed money in terms of what duration. Most people doing private lending offer loans at 10% to 15% daily. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your unique circumstances and the market conditions also, determine the rate at which you will charge interest. You also need to determine how much your limit is, depending on how much you have to offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Determine valid collaterals* \n",
    "\n",
    "Any client you lend money is a potential defaulter, no matter how much you trust them. You will need collateral when they borrow money, which you will retain or sell if they default, or return to them after they pay back the loan and interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to determine which collaterals you will take, which may as well be in line with your existing business like electronics if you are running an electronics shop. The collateral you take must be of much more worth than the amount the client is seeking to borrow, to ensure you are protected in case they default.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Market your private lending business* \n",
    "\n",
    "You had already identified a market gap and known that most people would need your private lending services. By word of mouth, social media, or any other local means, spread the word that you are offering such services. Let potential clients know that they can come to you when they need the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Recap:*\n",

    "\n",
    "Let all clients prove ownership of the item they bring as collateral (can provide receipts) to avoid the possibility of having been stolen.\n",

    "\n",
    "*How much capital do you need to start a private lending business in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have about Ksh.250,000 to Ksh.500,000 or more lying in your bank deposit accounts, you have enough to venture into private lending.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How profitable is a private lending business in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you lend out your Ksh.250,000 to Ksh.500,000, that is in small quantities to various people for 30 days with 15% daily interest, then at the end of the month you expect Ksh.1,125,000 to Ksh.2,250,000. Your money grew by a whole 450%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you don’t lend out the whole amount, whatever amount you lend will grow by 450% at the end of the month. Where else do you earn 450% on your money, if not in private lending?\n",

    "26/01/2022, 5:40 pm - +254 742 304047: *WHAT MUST YOU HAVE IN ORDER TO START A SUCCESSFUL DAIRY FARMING BUSINESS?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I am sure that the first thing that comes to your mind when you think about farming is land. Most people are discouraged from starting dairy farming because they do not have “enough land”.\n",
    "\n",
    "But look at what Nancy Karanja is doing on Sanla Farm. On just half an acre of land, where she lives and has three green houses, she is also keeping 20 dairy cows and getting over 500 litres of milk every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eden Farm, which earns the young Kanja more than Ksh.1 million every month, occupies not more than just 2 acres.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you see, even if you have a 40 X 80 piece of land, you can still do dairy farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you always wondered why dairy farming has become popular in the country? Do you love dairy animals but your work schedule, lack of land and little know how has kept your dreams grounded?\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know you can earn up-to Ksh.40,000 per month with 3 dairy cows?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya has been identified as the highest performer in Africa when it comes to dairy farming. Breeds that are used in Kenya are high breeders which yield milk between 30 to 50 Litres of milk per day with good management.\n",
    "\n",
    "One cow can produce an average milk yield of 30 Litres per day which is approximately 270 litres of milk from one cow per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Monthly Financial Income*\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently milk goes for Ksh.30 per litre at brookside. This will give you a gross income of 3 cows × 30 litres per day × Ksh.30 per litre × 30 days = Ksh.81,000 milk sales from 3 cows in one month.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of production is usually half the amount of litres per cow. The net income per month will therefore be\n",
    "\n",
    "Ksh.81,000 – Ksh.40,500 = Ksh.40,500 profit from 3 cows per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be successful in Dairy farming largely depends on the farmers’ ability to select the correct breeds of dairy animals for their various agro-ecological zones, correct feeding of the dairy animals and good management on various aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, to start dairy farming you need to be patient and have the capital needed to practice. i.e Capital to buy the cow itself, dairy feed, cow shelters and feeding troughs, veterinary expenses and a source of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Pokea Farm in Njoro makes over Ksh.600,000 per Month from Dairy Farming*\n",
    "\n",
    "The vehicles leave a cloud of dust on the murram road that meanders to Pokea Farm in Njoro Sub-county, some 15km from Nakuru town. It has not rained for about two weeks and the dust is reaching unbearable levels, especially for the residents living near the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacent farms hosting several crops that include maize and wheat are equally choking in dust. A signpost with the inscriptions “Pokea Dairy Farm, distributors of Hoisteins genetics for longevity and fitness cows built to last from Germany. Ask for artificial insemination services,” informs us that we have arrived at our destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Welcome to Pokea Farm,” farmer James Ndung’u says as he ushers us into the 17-acre farm that he has built to one of the finest dairy outfits in Kenya. He is not only a top breeder but also a leading milk producer, supplying his produce to Brookside Dairy, Njoro Farmers Cooperative Society and individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "His Holstein Friesian animals are distinctively black and white, although some light brown animals can also be spotted from far. They are sparkling clean, are big and bulky with sagging udders dripping with milk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cows have short horns and weigh between 500kg and 650kg, according to the records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Away from the cows, the cowsheds are well-ventilated with fine timber dust that is changed at least thrice a week to ensure high levels of hygiene making the beddings. The drinking troughs have clean water while the feeding mangers had some hay during our visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Eight acres is under Boma Rhodes grass, napier grass is on two acres while maize is on four acres. Sorghum occupies one acre, lucerne a quarter acre while the rest host barns, milking parlour and grazing field,” says Ndung’u of his meticulously planned farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enterprising farmer has 60 cows, 30 of which are pedigree and from the current 10 lactating stock, he gets an average of 400 litres of milk each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "His cows produce about 40 litres a day each, a feat that many farmers dream of. But there is one which offers up to 55 litres.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This is the magic cow. It gives me the most,” says Ndung’u as he strokes the animal. “I have never treated it against any diseases apart from now when I am closely monitoring mastitis as it is getting old.”\n",
    "\n",
    "And he has a piece of advice: “If you want to reap big from dairy farming, invest in your breeds because what you put in is what you get.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The Holstein Friesian pedigree animal has brought him fame and fortune.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‘champion’ produces an average of 44 litres of milk a day, hitting the over 50 litres some days, with no problem with mastitis. At between Sh.35 and Sh.50 per litre, it means the cow, which is now nine years old, earns Ndung’u a fortune.\n",
    "\n",
    "When he bought semen from the US at Sh.7,000 sometimes back, some farmers chided him, saying he was wasting money yet he could go for cheap semen of Sh.500.\n",
    "\n",
    "“But I do not regret. Every time dairy farmers ask me the secret of success, my answer is very simple: The choice of high quality semen is the first step to running a profitable dairy enterprise because you are assured of a top breed with minimal disease concerns,” Ndung’u, who started the business in 1979 with one cow after investing Sh.50,000 loan from Agricultural Finance Corporation, says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Tuesday, Pokea Farm is a beehive of activity as farmers from across the country and outside assemble there seeking fresh ideas on how to boost their milk production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers who come as a group are charged Sh.300 per person while individuals pay Sh.500. We found four filled visitors’ books signed by guests from Kenya, US, Norway, Germany, Hungary, South Africa, Zambia, and even Somalia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ndung’u, whose body frame and energy does not betray his 80 years, engages in the best animal husbandry practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a calf is born, it is critical that it develops a straight top line by making it almost skinny to prepare for a high milk production in future.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This is a secret that not many farmers know. To make a calf produce that straight top line, give it salt, hay and water in the first three months and reduce the consumption of early concentrates. The calf will look ill-fed with protruding ribs but this is an indication that the veins are now stronger and will allow faster blood movement and increase food efficiency resulting later to more milk production,” says the former primary school teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr Permius Migwi, a veterinary expert from Egerton University, says the feeding of animals with salts and adequate minerals help to build a strong backbone.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Minerals and good feeding in the early stages is crucial as it culminates in a strong backbone,” says Dr Migwi.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Ndung’u, raising healthy animals has a lot to do with managing a cow’s stress, an area many farmers score poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A cow also needs enough rest and should not be moved from one point to another unnecessarily as this will stress it and interfere with its milk production system,” says Ndung’u, a father of three.\n",
    "\n",
    "“At the same time the animals should be left to relax after milking and should not be moved hurriedly.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Cows at Pokea Farm are bathed twice a week with hot water mixed with Sunlight powder. Special attention is given to the udder.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We also clean the cowsheds twice a day to make sure teats are not infected with mastitis or other diseases.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the animals, the more than 20 staff on the farm too maintain high-level of hygiene.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There is no point of having a clean cow that is being handled by a dirty worker as this will definitely affect the health of the animal. All my workers bath before handling animals,” says Ndung’u, who has invested heavily in training staff. He also spends Sh.300,000 on salary monthly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training has equipped his workers with knowledge to detect problems an animal has and the remedy to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ndungu feeds his dairy cows on napier grass, Rhodes grass, lucerne, maize and sorghum silage, which is nutritious and contains energy and protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I mix a tonne of silage with 20kg of dried pyrethrum to curb aflatoxin. You have to feed a cow according to its weight. We feed a cow that weighs 650kg with 30kg silage and 20kg roughage twice a day,” he says, noting the animals are fed at 9am, 1pm and 5pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If a dairy farmer strictly adheres to such a feeding programme, which includes concentrates, the animals will remain healthy and produce more milk.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many farmers, he does not bury his silage in the ground. He harvests his fodder at dough stage and covers it in a canvas and then puts soil on top, avoiding excess moisture.\n",
    "\n",
    "He sells heifers at between Sh.150,000 and Sh.250,000 while pedigree cows go for between Sh.300,000 and Sh.600,000. His clients range from the small farmer to who-is-who in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I import Friesian Holstein sexed semen from Germany to serve my cows, which guarantees me the calves born are all female,” says Ndung’u, who also sells semen to farmers at between Sh.500 and Sh.9,600.\n",
    "\n",
    "His animals are vaccinated against diseases such as lump-skin, foot and mouth and East Coast Fever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recordkeeping and a strict business plan is also part of the high milk yield strategy on the farm. “All the details of every cow, including the artificial insemination date, date of birth, diseases and milk production, among others, are documented,” says Ndung’u whose animals are registered with the Kenya Stud Book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ndung’u has drilled a borehole at a cost of Sh.4 million that supplies 10,000 litres of water in two hours for the animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "His success in dairy farming has put Kenya on the global dairy map as he won the prestigious Golden Award for Commercial Prestige in Madrid, Spain in 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "He received overwhelming support from 112 countries and 7,000 companies in the dairy industry across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ndung’u has also received awards as a top breeder in all local trade fairs he has attended.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of his biggest challenges is poor commercial feeds and substandard minerals, which affects milk production. The turnover of workers is another challenge as he is forced to invest in training of staff who seek greener pastures elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diseases such as foot and mouth, mastitis and lump skin too are a menace, though he has managed to keep them at bay for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "One piece of advice he always gives farmers is that they should treat their animals like newly-born babies and make sure they are vaccinated against diseases, just like children. They must also make sure they have the best feeds in their formative years.\n",
    "\n",
    "He plans to retire and pass the baton to his son John Karanja who lives in the US and has shown a keen interest in dairy farming.\n",

    "\n",
    "It strikes me that human life was built on the foundation of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever enjoyed the privilege of watching a baby walk for the first time? It’s an amazing sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most babies never succeed the first time they try; they often fail, fall and cry.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then something interesting happens; every baby tries again. Failure after failure, he tries again.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a couple of months, he’ll be running all over the place, having fun and being naughty. Those same legs that couldn’t stand and walk will have learned to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "How? It’s all about trial and error. That’s what life is about.\n",
    "\n",
    "To succeed in most things, failure is often involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s society, failure has earned such a bad name that nobody in her right mind wants to be associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only when people become successful do we celebrate them on magazine covers and in the news. We admire them. We want to be like them. We think they have a magic charm that we do not possess. It’s no wonder that success attracts a lot of fans and friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "If most successful entrepreneurs told you how many times they failed before achieving success, you may doubt it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the media shares a huge chunk of the blame in this regard. We tend to focus too much on the success side of every story and refuse to consider the dark moments of failure and long nights of toiling that come before.\n",
    "\n",
    "We forget how many times that successful businessman tried to raise capital and failed. We may not even know that he started four different businesses that failed before he stumbled on a successful business.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is often a failure side to every success story. The problem is, nobody is telling it and nobody wants to listen.\n",

    "Show me a successful entrepreneur who has never failed and I will show you a liar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody is above failure.\n",

    "\n",
    "A man or a lady walks into a bar/restaurant/hotel/boutique/car repair shop, chances are, he/she found it online either on Google, Facebook, jiji.co.ke etc. That’s because today’s consumers, 80% according to Google, rely more on the Web to find and choose local businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you make sure that these consumers find and choose your local business? Do you already market your business online in Kenya?\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet has become a vital communication tool for both business and social interactions. But this is not all it is used for, everyday we discover new ways in which we can use the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet has opened new markets for businesses across the world. As long as you have internet connection, then you can buy and sell products/services from any corner of the world. So how then do you expose your business to this global marketplace?\n",
    "\n",
    "Buying and selling products online in Kenya was not a popular thing until recently. Unlike in the past, nowadays, there are many websites where anyone in Kenya can sell their products and make profit out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these websites are owned by companies and open to everyone to post their products while others are individual online stores limited to the owners`s products.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to sell your goods and services, here are the best Websites to sell your items for a profit in Kenya:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Jiji.co.ke (Formally OLX)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses can post their advertisements for items, goods and services on this site. It is popular for buying and selling of household items, cars, electronics, jobs listings and services e.t.c.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been the leading free advert listing website in Kenya with thousands of products listed daily. Although there are no online transactions carried out through the platform, the company has made effort to top the list by ensuring that the website gets a lot of traffic (buyers and sellers).\n",
    "\n",
    "The buyer and seller have to meet and trade physically.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Pigiame.co.ke*\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the term describes the websites, Pigiame, meaning get in contact with me. Pigiame.co.ke has been around for a long time now and is yet another popular trading website in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buyers and Sellers advertise their goods and services on the platform. People browsing the adverts contact the sellers in case they are interested. Like jiji.co.ke, Pigiame is free for users to list their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Jumia.co.ke*\n",
    "\n",
    "Jumia has been one of the successful online market place in Kenya. This website has products listing from the company and there are online payment options plus free delivery services within Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company has also introduced a section where other people can sell their products through the same website. But the company collects payment ensuring that seller gets access to their money after they deliver the product to the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature protects both the buyer and the seller making it a safe online trading platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Property24.co.ke*\n",
    "\n",
    "At Property24.co.ke, traders specialize on properties only. Most adverts are houses, apartments, flats or estates on sale or for lent. The company lists properties for individuals and agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an online trading website, the seller uploads photos for their property plus their contacts, then interested buyer contacts them for a deal. It is simple to use and those who sell and rent properties make profit through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Biashara.co.ke*\n",
    "\n",
    "Biashara.co.ke is a free advertising website. Anyone can post their products on the platform for buyers to find it. As a seller, you need to register on the website before listing products and services. It has similarities with Jiji and Pigiame.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Ticketsasa.com*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most popular website that sells exclusive tickets in Kenya. For those holding events, theater plays, or any event that require tickets, Ticketsasa simplifies that. Users post their events and price per ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once posted, the participants can then access the online market platform and make their purchase. Selling tickets is usually an easy and a profitable method since the website can be accessed from any internet device.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In Conclusion*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every business seeks to improve its bottom line through various marketing efforts to increase its sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "Market your business online in Kenya to take advantage of this vast platforms.\n",

    "27/01/2022, 7:57 pm - +254 701 711058: *THE BUSINESS OF SELLING FRESH VEGETABLES AND CEREALS IN NAIROBI*\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have low capital, it’s always hard to determine what kind of business to start in Nairobi. But after observing consumer trends in the city, I can attest that cereal & vegetable business is one of the best venture to set up, and here is the reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most important thing to consider before arriving at the decision to open any kind of business is how the market will respond to your new venture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at Nairobi, there is a huge population which relies on cereals and vegetables for survival. A good number, which is estimated to be 30%, have strict instructions from the doctor to consider vegetables as alternative to meat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing very well that profits from vegetable and cereal business exceed the buying price, this is the kind of business that is ideal for anyone intending to make a living.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have not only observed individuals making a kill out of Fresh vegetable business, but I have also experienced it. Fresh vegetable business is one of the most profitable ventures in Nairobi and its environs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start the business, one has to identify a suitable location which is highly populated. I would advise you to avoid posh estates like Karen, Runda, Kileleshwa and Muthaiga because residents in these areas usually buy their vegetables from shopping malls and supermarkets. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was inspired to write this article by a multimillionaire businesswoman who rose from a Sh.500 vegetable business to become a manager of three companies.\n",
    " \n",
    "Christine Chege is the manager of insurance, real estate and business consultancy companies worth more than Sh.500 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "At only 30 years of age, Christine is already a lawyer but not practicing, a manager, a mother of three, a wife and a mentor.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was mentored by her father, a farmer who encouraged her to join business. She has never been employed but she has employed many people.\n",
    "\n",
    "At 22, Christine bought her first car, a pick-up, with money she was earning from selling vegetables, milk and meat, which used to come from Githurai.\n",
    "\n",
    "She paid her own school fees to pursue law but later realized she needed to do business rather than law. \n",
    "\n",
    "She now uses her law skills and knowledge in her businesses. “I could hawk vegetables while my other colleagues were busy studying. It was not that easy,” Christine said.\n",
    "\n",
    "She said from Marikiti to Gikomba, there is no place she has never sold her products. She encourages women to work hard and be prayerful because life requires determination and patience. \n",
    "\n",
    "“I remember at times when my friends used to ask, ‘Are you not the one we saw at Gikomba during the day,’” Christine said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“During the day when my colleagues were learning, I was busy in the market selling chicken, meat, milk and vegetables,” Christine said. Her business grew until she was able to buy the pick-up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Her advice to other entrepreneurs is that if you are starting small, it is good to be consistent, resilient, put God first and give as you receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A business is a business and male dominance does not exist when it comes to business, it is your strategy that matters,” she said. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best estates to start the Fresh Vegetables and cereals business include Kawangware, South B, South C, Embakasi, Githurai, Kayole, Komarock, Kahawa West, Kahawa Sukari, Ruiru, Umoja, Donholm, Huruma and Muthurwa market.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are areas where majority of the people rely on unga from posho mill as well as vegetables.\n",
    " \n",
    "Fresh vegetable business can fit in a grocery or be conducted in an open air market. To start a grocery, you need a capital of at least Sh.100,000. But if you intend to start the business in an open air market, Sh.1,000 is enough as capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to capital required to start the cereals business, I decided to ask more than 20 traders how much it took them to start. From the calculations, the average capital required to start cereal business in Nairobi is Ksh.50,000 to Ksh.150,000. This money is inclusive of rental and transportation expenses. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is always advisable to sell cereals alongside vegetables so as to give customers a complete package. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most vegetables are ferried from Kisii, Central Kenya and Kajiado, but the best vegetables are those ferried from Kisii. Some of the vegetables, which are becoming popular among residents, are mostly found in Kisii, they include saga, managu and kunde.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also large scale traders in Muthurwa market who can sell to you cheaply. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cereals can be sourced from Kisii, Central Kenya and Rift Valley. You can also source the cereals from Nyamakima, Muthurwa or Gikomba market before you make enquiries on where the traders obtain their cereals from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Profits you expect from fresh vegetable business are not fixed, though most traders make Sh.500 to Sh.5,000 per day. There is no loss reported in this business, unless the vegetables overstay during transportation and get spoilt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where the beauty of the business lies. The average profit made in this business depends on the capital injected on the business as well as location. If you set the business in densely populated areas, you will make at least Ksh.2,500 per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business can generate as high as Ksh.10,000 per day if you have both cereals, vegetables and fruits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also you can grow your business to a level whereby you will be supplying Cereals, Vegetables and Fruits to other small groceries and cereals businesses in your area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of wasting time working for somebody while earning less than Ksh.20,000 per month, you can venture into this business and make a big difference.\n",

    "\n",
    "The stock market is a way to turn your cash into more cash. The thought of making money in stocks seems very attractive and enticing. But how long should you wait to actually make some money?\n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, you can make money in stocks in as short as 30 minutes, or as long as a couple of years. It depends on how you approach the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Day trading, as the name suggests, only takes a day to make money. On the other hand, long term trading takes at least a year invested on a stock. Swing trading is somewhere between the two. Most of the time, swing trading gains income from 2 weeks to a couple of months.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, the longer time you invest, the more money you can earn. It is done by the power of compound interest where interest income earns more income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, the shorter time you invest, the riskier it is. The longer you invest, the less riskier it becomes.\n",

    "\n",
    "I bet you have heard of the golden hass avocado. The hass avocado is the most popular Kenyan avocado produced mainly for export purposes. It has a good market in continents such as Europe compared to other types of avocados.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of avocado was first grown in Guatemala. Hass avocado farming is really profitable to farmers because it has a ready international market for the locals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hass avocado exports have actually taken the place of major cash crops such as coffee. The government has negotiated with firms such as Kakuzi to buy the fruits from farmers, which has helped in eliminating brokers thus yielding more returns for farmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers are required to deliver quality fruit and in return Kakuzi buys them at a very good price. Payment is always done seven days after delivery. This is guaranteed payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most prominent feature of hass avocado is that it turns dark purple when ripe. Hass avocado offers several benefits which also apply across the family of avocado.\n",
    "\n",
    "*They are a significant source of good cholesterol.\n",
    "\n",
    "*High in protein and mineral content as compared to animal proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Used in the manufacture of facial and hair oil.\n",
    "\n",
    "*They boost farmers economically besides earning foreign currency for the exporting country.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is the difference between a hass avocado and a regular avocado?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular avocados are larger in size and smooth skinned while the hass avocados are smaller and have a pebbly skin that turns dark purple when ripe.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the biggest difference is the nutritional value in terms of fat content. For instance, two or three slices of a hass avocado contain 4.6 grams of fat and the same portion of a regular avocado contains an estimate of 3 grams of fat.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to plant hass avocado tree*\n",
    "\n",
    "Avocados can be grown from either seedlings or seeds. Through grafting, farmers are able to improve variety by increasing its resistance to diseases and increasing its adaptability to different types of soils.\n",
    "\n",
    "Planting materials should be inspected to ensure that they are free from diseases. Seeds should also be treated with hot water not exceeding 50 degrees Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kenya Avocado Society is in a fresh drive to recruit farmers to plant Hass avocado variety at a time when the demand of the crop is high in international markets such as China with populations keen on consuming healthy fruits and food.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Oxnard, the largest distributor of avocados in the world, avocado sales to China this year is expected to double compared to a similar period last year. China is one of the world’s largest importer of avocados.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Kenya, the price of a 90kg bag of avocados has risen to Sh.2,560 the highest price since 2014 according to the Directorate of Horticulture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya produces an estimated 115,000 metric tonnes of avocados annually, 70 per cent of which is grown by smallholder farmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Africa, Kenya is the second largest exporter of avocados after South Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes back, shortage of the commodity led to ban of exports as some farmers were accused of picking immature fruits which were not suitable for both local and international markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We are recruiting farmers all over the country to plant avocados in a five year investment plan that is set to earn farmers more income than maize for instance while at the same time increasing forest cover” said Meshack Kamau, the sales and marketing officer at the Kenya Avocado Society.\n",
    "\n",
    "To join the society one has to pay an annual subscription fee of Sh.1,000 and will get seedlings at a subsidized price.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We sell avocado seedlings to members at Sh.200 compared Sh.300 for non-members,” said Kamau.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kenya Avocado Society can be reached on +254 723 491 549 or +254 722 575 544\n",
    "\n",
    " *Land preparation*\n",
    "\n",
    "Land preparation should be similar to that of other crops. It is advisable to plant an annual crop before in order to achieve the desired tillage if the land is newly cleared. Also ensure there are windbreakers such as hedges if there are strong winds in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Planting holes*\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers are advised to plant the trees in a straight line to ease crop husbandry and harvesting. For hass avocados in Kenya, the rectangular pattern of planting is preferred as it eases movement of machinery between the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method also makes it easy for pruning, thinning and inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hass avocado tree spacing*\n",
    "\n",
    "Spacing depends on factors such as climatic conditions and soil fertility. It may range from 6m by 7m to 8m by 10m. The planting holes should be around 60cm to 70cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Planting*\n",
    "\n",
    "Use two buckets of farmyard manure mixed with topsoil, 250gms of double superphosphate fertilizer and a certified insecticide to fill the holes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that planting is done after the start of rains when the rainwater has penetrated the soil properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful not to damage the roots when filling up the holes. Irrigation should be done after the first shoot appears and the young plant should be tied to sticks for support.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pruning*\n",
    "\n",
    "This starts at the planting stage if the roots are too long and do not fit the planting hole. Trees at an early age are trained in order to maintain a good framework. Pruning is mainly done before the plants begin to flower and upon completion of harvesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general rule is that the tree canopy height should be 70% of row width to allow dissemination of light. Pruning is beneficial to the trees as it enables them to yield and provide a superior structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Thinning*\n",
    "\n",
    "It involves removing some of the already formed fruits to reduce competition for nutrients thus producing high-quality fruits. Lack of thinning leads to the production of small-sized fruits.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Weed control*\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces competition for both water and nutrients. Weed control can be done by cover cropping, mulching and mechanical cultivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Harvesting*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kenya hass avocado flowers on October and are ready for picking between June and September. Farmers should identify the correct harvesting period because the avocado fruits are picked raw and ripen off the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Return for an acre with 150 trees.*\n",
    "\n",
    "An avocado tree typically produces about one million flowers yearly but as I explained earlier, you have to do thinning.\n",
    "\n",
    "It involves removing some of the already formed fruits to reduce competition for nutrients thus producing high-quality fruits. Lack of thinning leads to the production of small-sized fruits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The least Forecasted returns for the first 10 years in a one acre land is as follows. (Prices of hass fruit range between ksh.8 – Ksh.20 in local market depending on size.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The first two years – growth stage\n",
    "\n",
    "• 2nd year (harvest of 50 fruits per tree) – Ksh.60,000\n",
    "\n",
    "• 3rd year (harvest 200 – 250 fruits per tree) – Ksh.240,000\n",
    "\n",
    "• 4th year (400 fruits per tree) – Ksh.480,000\n",
    "\n",
    "• 5th year – (800 fruits per tree)- Ksh.900,000\n",
    "\n",
    "• 6th year – (1000 fruits per tree) – Ksh.1.08 million\n",
    "\n",
    "• 7th year – (1100 fruits per tree) – Ksh.1.3 million\n",
    "\n",
    "• 8th year – (more than 1300 fruits per tree) – Ksh.1.5 million\n",
    "\n",
    "• 9th year – (more than 1500 fruits per tree) – Ksh.1.8 million\n",
    "\n",
    "• 10th year – (more than 1750 fruits per tree) – Ksh.2 million\n",
    "\n",
    "Total cumulative returns in 10 years is Ksh.10 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that:*\n",
    "\n",
    "We have calculated the prices of each fruit at a minimum price of Ksh.8 as of the local market. These prices can range between Ksh.8 to Ksh.20.\n",
    "\n",
    "The life span of a hass avocado tree is more than 50 years. Let your idle land become profitable by investing in hass avocados.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing about hass avocado is that its market is growing each day and big companies like kakuzi and sasini have embraced this opportunity by planting thousands of their acres under hass avocado due to stability of the hass market and high returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hass avocado is the least stressful form of farming because it’s a tree with least form of management, you just have to visit your shamba when harvesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isn’t that something worth pondering upon?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we always tell you, there’s no marathon race that has ever been won by those who did not start the race.\n",

    "\n",
    "Today I will be sharing with you a topic which interests most of us (or all of us)… how to make money.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, what is money?\n",
    "\n",
    "I know, that question sounds stupid. Since you are not a baby, of course you know the definition of money and what money is. Your teacher in primary or secondary school must have taught you that money is a medium of exchange of goods and services (or something similar).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, listen to my definition of money … money is the reward we get for offering value and making the world a better place.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we see money in the light of my above definition, we will have a better approach for creating wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create wealth, you have to understand that your primary task is to offer the world around you (your street, your city, your country, your village) some value. Riches are only a reward, not a goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain with an illustration I love very much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our families needed eggs and some chickens to slaughter at Christmas, they would start rearing chicks. Though they really didn’t care about chicks, they would feed them, shelter them and care for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some time, these chicks would grow up, become chickens and start laying eggs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rich people understand this principle better.\n",
    "\n",
    "You too should understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating wealth is about giving first, then getting rewarded later.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3 ways to make money*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me quickly share with you three ways by which money can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in some illegal ways. I know this is not for you. I am just writing this for both of us to understand this issue of money making very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know people get money by stealing, people get money through political frauds, People get money through hard drugs and some other dirty things like selling fake products.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don`t need to tell you… those are odd and risky ways to get money and you won`t become (truly) rich from any of the above ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "What value is the money you get in exchange for your peace of mind?\n",
    "\n",
    "It isn`t worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way you can get some money is by getting a job.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was nothing bad in getting a job until recently when things started changing in the population and the economy of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last 100 years for example, the whole world`s population was less than 2 billion. Most of the worlds population was in the rural areas and others who were in urban areas were having more companies calling them than they could work with. Remember there was no much technology, so most of the jobs were done by human beings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting a job was interesting and that was the reason why school was the best place to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, things have changed so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "The world’s population is now over 7 billion. Technologies are doing most jobs. Good jobs are now very (did I say very very?) scares, so job is no more a good way to create wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, our universities, polytechnics and colleges are still busy teaching our young adults how to be employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "To me, we are very stupid to continue teaching our children how to get jobs when we are all aware that there are no more good jobs. But am happy the government has introduced a new education system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let`s continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "After I have cleared out some dirty means of getting rich and I have explained the reason why getting a job cannot make you rich, then, the only dependable way to make money (especially in 21st century) is to be a business owner.\n",

    "Honestly, it`s not a very easy thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ounch! I shouldn`t have told you that. I am sorry. I should have told you, “You see, making money is very easy”. Isn`t that what most people on the internet say these days? Yet, I mustn`t tell you that. I have to tell you the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do I really mean that it`s not possible to be rich?\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that`s what some people will “hear”, though I never said that. Getting all the money you need for your life isn`t an impossible dream, but it requires some know-how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making money as a business owner can be by producing a product, selling someone else`s product, rendering a service or selling your talent (just as football players, movie artists and musicians are doing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you are selling your own product, another person`s product, a service or your talent, you are an entrepreneur.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create wealth as an entrepreneur if you can do these three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. If you can learn.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The number one problem in today`s generation and economy is the lack of financial literacy. Most people who ask the question, how can I make money, really are not told where to start. Where to start is to be business minded.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know, you have been “good job minded” all your life. That`s not your fault. That`s the fault of school. Now, you must become business minded. Open your mind to business. Think business. Talk business. Plan business and… read business.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are mindful of something, you will want it to be the number one thing in your thoughts and you will want to know about it… in and out… left and right… up and down. Believe me, if anyone asks me “what is the solution to the problem of poverty and unemployment in Africa?” my answer will be in two words… financial education (or business education).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary reason why there are more poor people in the world than rich people is because most people don`t know how to be rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read this quote and think about it… “There is a secret psychology of money. Most people don`t know about it. That`s why most people never become successful” … T. Harv. Eker.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know someone may have a question here… what if I want to sell my talent as a footballer, musician etc., do I still have to be financially literate? Yes. A musician who doesn`t understand marketing and other business concepts may sing good songs, but he/she may not be able to sell one thousand copies of his/her work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many athletes have made millions of shillings and lost all because they really did not understand how to keep money growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a writer who writes the best books, you will need business skills to sell your book and financial skill to keep that wealth growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are most people ignorant about wealth acquisition? Why is it that most people don`t know that there are some skills to be acquired in order to be rich?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because school never taught us how to make money and whatever school doesn`t teach, most people don`t know because they are not ready to learn outside what school teaches. The good news is, reading books about business is very interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business/financial books will not bore you like academic books… because they are always very practical and interesting. I started reading about business when I was around 17/18. I fell in love with business and motivational books to a point where I carried them everywhere I went (even up till now).\n",
    "\n",
    "Back then, when I was in campus, I could read 30-50 books (about business, finance, leadership etc.) every year. Some of my friends would have advised me to avoid failing as a result of reading too many non-academic books, but they couldn`t (since I was the best student in my class).\n",
    "\n",
    "My dear fellow Africans, will you believe me if I tell you the truth? Financial education is the place to start, if truly you want to acquire wealth and become rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "What should you do? Where should you start from?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, read everything we post in our PROFITABLE BUSINESS IDEAS Whatsapp Group. You will be wiser, smarter, and be on your way to be rich after reading all the business articles in our group. After all, they are free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, attend some (If not all) our business trainings that we organize on Whatsapp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, reach out and get some good financial and business books in a nearby bookstore or download them online at pdfdrive.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "About 7 years ago I was reading a book by Brian Sher. Sher said, “The shortest cut to riches is financial education”. He is very right.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Be a doer.*\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start acquiring financial education, (almost instantly), your eyes will start opening to money making business opportunities around you. You will start “seeing” gold you never saw before, all around you. When this starts happening, you have to be a doer, an actor, a runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurs are actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are not talkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be faced (or you are already being faced) with the temptation to start big or perfectly. Resist that temptation! Starting a business is rarely smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Sam Adeyemi (a Nigeria motivational speaker) said, “start where you are with what you have”, he was offering a great advice. Most people understand that the best way to acquire riches is to be an entrepreneur, yet they are still waiting, for what? For a perfect moment, great idea, huge capital\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to be a doer, an actor, a runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have got a business idea? Start it little, with all your heart and life. When you start, growing becomes easier. When you start, nature comes to your aid.\n",
    "\n",
    "I came across a powerful quotation that inspired me about 8 years ago. Let me share it with you…\n",
    "\n",
    "“Whatever you do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius and power and magic in it”… Johann Goethe\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Cut failure away from your dictionary.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As an entrepreneur, your opinion about what people call failure must be different. For an average person, failure is when you attempt something and do not succeed at achieving your aim. Business people don`t see that as failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years I have been amazed by how “failures” led me to the higher ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most times what you will see happening is that, you attempt something, you are hit by defeat (usually bitter and makes you cry). But that “failure” forces you to think in another direction (and of course, makes you smarter). Right at your new direction lies better success. It`s not uncommon to see entrepreneurs who start an entirely different line of business getting wonderfully successful in a new field that “failure” forced them to.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have experienced many “failures” in my entrepreneurial journey. Some of them made me wake up at night and cry, some of them made me to think I was stupid to be in business in the first place while all of them have made me a better person.\n",
    "\n",
    "As someone who desires to make money, you have to cut out the word failure from your own dictionary. You have to see failure as a ladder which has to be climbed to the riches you desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthony Robbins in his book, Unlimited Power, encourages us to learn how to manage frustration. In his own view, the more frustrations you can cope with (and still continue pursuing your dream), the more wealth you will acquire.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conclusion.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If truly you desire to be rich, your primary task is to think about the value you can sell, either as a product, a service or your talent. Any of this may require some hard work, commitment, practice and dedication, but you can be sure you will make money at the end of the rope.\n",

    "29/01/2022, 12:13 pm - +254 701 711058: *WITH SH.300,000 YOU CAN START A MINERAL WATER DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS AND MAKE OVER KSH.20,000 WEEKLY*\n",
    "\n",
    "With an estimated 50,000 graduates that Kenyan universities produce every year not to mention other graduates from vocational training institutions, unemployment is becoming a real disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows therefore that there is need for business ideas that can help, especially the youth to get engaged in and make a living and the bottled water distribution business is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Kenya, bottled water market continues to thrive with sales estimated at Sh.12 billion per year and over 100 brands available can provide a niche market for distributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being one of the essential commodities in every society, water actually falls under fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) that sales quickly and at a relatively low cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Sh.300,000 you can venture in the distribution of bottled mineral water and be sure of making cool cash on a weekly basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can start by buying some two second hand motorcycles which are relatively cheaper as compared to tuktuks or band new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several online sites in Kenya where you can find people selling secondhand motorcycles at between Sh.35,000 and Sh.55,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a Tornado of 125cc and still in high performance can be found at Sh.35,000 on pigiame.co.ke while a Boxer Bajaj of 150cc goes at Sh.40,000 on the same site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume you settle on two that costs Sh.40,000 each of which you can operate one as you employ another person to help you with the other, you will still remain with Sh.220,000 that can enable you to go for some bottles of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Sh.15 each (wholesale price), you can actually buy 14,666 bottles of 300ml which you can distribute at Sh.17 per bottle and make an extra Sh.2 per bottle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will arrive you at Sh.249,322 translating to Sh.29,322 gross profit a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you minus about Sh.5,000, your operation costs which include fuel, labour and other expenses weekly, you will remain with Sh.24,322 in a single week, Sh.97,288 net income in a month and further Sh.1,167,456 net in a year‬.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is how simple you can become a millionaire in a year. However, this will depend on the effort put to realise daily goals as with business you need to be timely and consistent to match or even outdo your competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the wholesale price of the 300ml mineral water bottles can be increased to Sh.25 from Sh.15 given the fluctuation nature of the Kenyan market, you can still make some profit just at a distribution rate of Sh.2 up per bottle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In business, it is that small margin that will make your service be sought-after by your clients and hence have an edge over your competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, in every business there are risks but it takes a leap of faith to invest in ideas which are well calculated, planned and implemented to realise good returns.\n",

    "When I first met Lilian, she was in the verge of giving up on her business. She had tirelessly worked for over 10 years to make it profitable. She had beaten all the odds to maintain her profit margins year after the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Her business now was sinking though she never got to know why. As we were discussing the issue, a few things came up. The business was doing well until the time Martin, her husband came in as a business partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both were to run the business on trust basis. The agony on her was unrelatable. Her years of sweat were slowly being reduced to ash. The question she was asking herself is what happened? \n",
    "\n",
    "Where did she suddenly go wrong? \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer a few of the many questions she had, and may be many individuals are going through, i decided to write this article. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the unique lessons you can learn from this article:\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you avoid business collapse as a family?\n",
    "\n",
    "How well should one maintain his/her finances? What is the best approach to a family business?\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we sort out the differences that money matters bring?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish this, the following should be adhered to;\n",
    "\n",
    "Let each partner run his /her business. This will ensure that the one in charge of the business is solely responsible. Most of the conflict come as a result of blame game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disagreement on the best way to run a business results in collapse. As long as only one person runs the business it is easier to account for.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Chip In Financially*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the only way the two parties may come together to uplift one another. In case one party's business is not doing well, it is necessary to boost one another. This doesn’t mean that the running of the business will shift. It is just for financial support to avoid fall of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Give Account Of Progress*\n",
    "\n",
    "This will ensure that the other partner is aware of what is happening in each business. The aim of this is not to take charge of your partner’s management. It is solely to enable each other understand the business better. In case one is sick or may not be able to operate in a day everything moves on well.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Keep Records*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every business needs account of records. At the end of the day one needs to figure out how the business is doing. This can only be achieved through recording of day’s activities. This gives smooth flow of business. Also it enables one to know when to replenish stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reconcile The Accounts*\n",
    "\n",
    "Books of accounts are a must for any business. Therefore make it a routine to have proper controls. The reconciliations may be done daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly depending on the business nature. This is every business watchdog to curb any loopholes in the business. If need be involve a professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It Is Our Business At The End Of Day*\n",
    "\n",
    "It ensures proper business management in that each partner is aware of the activities going on. Even if not fully running the business, at least the slightest idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way in case of challenges it is easily solved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have an open mind and ready to ask for guidance. Also it becomes a platform to table the challenges and strengths of the business. Any improvement should be done together.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It Is A Way Of Diversifying Risks*\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that each partner runs their own business, it is a way of mitigation of risk. This is so because if one business collapses the other continues. Thus, the risks are diversified. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to stabilize the family's financial income. Losses in business are inevitable. If the same happens the family remains stable. Therefore, in case one business collapses the other is intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally,*\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in jobs segregation of duties is always important. It is good to know your stand in every idea or your role in the family business or businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures each person is responsible for progress or collapse if any may be experienced. Also it enables one to account for the cash flow.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to keep refining your knowledge of investments so that you can take advantage of emerging opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only by doing this that you will be able to get your money to work for you instead of leaving it to lay idle in a bank account. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to share with you some important information you need before you start investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have tried our best to use the simplest explanations possible for easy understanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "*What Are Stocks and How Do They Work?*\n",
    "\n",
    "A stock (or a share) is a small piece of ownership in a business. For instance, in 2008 Safaricom went public and offered every person an opportunity to own a piece of it. Each share was then priced at Ksh.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say Mr. Juma bought stocks worth Ksh.10,000 at that time and waited. So technically Mr. Juma became an owner of Safaricom — and as you know when you become a business owner, you are entitled to a share of its profit at the end of each financial year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What Are Bonds and How Do They Work?*\n",
    "\n",
    "A bond is a debt, and when you buy one you are simply lending the government your money. For example, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) recently rolled out M-Akiba bond that you can buy for as little as Ksh.3,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say Mr. Otieno buys bonds worth Ksh.30,000 and waits. So technically Mr. Otieno has lent the government his money — and as you know when you lend money, you are entitled to getting the agreed interest rates (also known as coupons or bond returns).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Which Investment Pays More?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Stocks tend to pay more particularly if you invest in a profitable company. But timing is key. If you buy stocks from a growing company then you can only hope for good returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bonds on the other hand give you relatively less but smooth returns (typically 12.5%). They are a good option if you are a long-term investor especially due to the power of compounding (in the case of zero coupon bonds).\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much Can I Make If I Invest Ksh.10,000?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Stocks can double or triple your money especially if you do the right timing. But on the other hand, if you get it all wrong, then you can as well bite some losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bonds on the other hand can give you as much as 20% returns per annum – and given the power of compound interest rate, they offer great potential for growth especially in the long-term.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Which Option Guarantees Me of Returns?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re looking for “guaranteed” returns then bonds are the best investment option to make. Historically, bond prices fluctuate less than stock prices. Depending on how you invest in them, they can offer returns that are guaranteed, or close to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stocks on the other hand are not guaranteed. If the company you have invested in makes losses and declares bankruptcy then you may not get any returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you bought Mumias stocks while they were priced at Ksh.15 and today they are selling at Ksh.3 then your returns may not be anything worth talking about. On the other hand you can hold on, and if the company resurrects, the share prices will rise and all will be well.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Minimum Investment Required*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can buy bonds worth as little as Ksh.3,000. You can start trading in stock with as little as Ksh.10,000. So anyone can invest and this is no longer a privilege of the rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stocks Vs. Bonds – Which Is Better?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonds are better for those who are cautious about taking risks. You are guaranteed to get your investment plus interest back – unless the Government goes bankrupt. Besides that, tax-free bonds have attractive interest rates which are way above what banks and Saccos offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stocks on the other hand are a good choice for anyone who is ready to take a greater degree of risk. You are guaranteed to grow your money faster provided the company you invest in operates profitably. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called, *INVESTING IN STOCKS TRAINING*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this group we are going to train you and teach you for 22 days how you can Invest in the Stocks Market in Kenya profitably. We will also have discussions, questions and answers sessions in the group.\n",

    "\n",
    "80% of those who venture into hardware business close shop in less than 2 years due to losses and cash-flow problems. The good news however, is that there are those few lucky ones who survive against all odds and live to share the cake as cut-throat competition fades away.\n",
    "\n",
    " But what really separates the wheat from the chaff?\n",
    " \n",
    "As a potential hardware owner, it is important that you are up to speed with some trade secrets. In other words you need to be armed with some market survival tactics that an ordinary business classroom doesn't offer.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this brief article, we give you some street smarts of starting a successful general hardware and construction equipment supplies shop in Kenya.\n",
    " \n",
    "*1. Know Your Market*\n",
    " \n",
    "As a rule of the thumb you need to understand your market thoroughly before you commit your money to the business. First, you need to identify places with ready (and growing) market potential for hardware products.\n",
    " \n",
    "Secondly, you need to be in sync with the trends and ruling prices of the industry. You also need to do a strength, weakness, opportunities and threats analysis (S.W.O.T) with particular focus on what your potential competitors are up to.\n",
    " \n",
    "To guide you in your research work, here are some 5 questions that you need to find answers to:\n",
    " \n",
    "(1) Which is the best place to start a hardware business in terms of market potential?\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) How many competitors are already on the market?\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) How much money I'm I willing to spend to penetrate the market?\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) What is the greatest weakness with my potential competitors and how can I use it as a launching pad for my business?\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Given past, and recent past trends, what does the future for the business look like?\n",
    " \n",
    "*2. Which is the Best Place To Start a Hardware Shop?*\n",
    " \n",
    "The best place to start a hardware is where there is an upcoming community of people who are building their first homes.\n",
    " \n",
    "Look for possible future satellite towns and start small. As the estate grows, your business will most likely grow as it benefits from customer loyalty which can be earned by operating in the market over a long period of time.\n",
    " \n",
    "For those in Nairobi and its environs, the best places to set up shop would be along Kangundo road, Eastern Bypass and Magadi Road.\n",
    " \n",
    "It is however important to ascertain that you are choosing a market that has enough purchasing power i.e. customers who can potentially spend at least Ksh.20,000 per month and pay on time.\n",
    " \n",
    "*3. What about Competition?*\n",
    " \n",
    "Hardware business has minimal barriers of entry and for this reason cut throat competition is quite a common feature.\n",
    " \n",
    "The first step in dealing with competition is to avoid it in the first place. Ideally, you should set-up shop in upcoming estates and grow slowly as the market expands.\n",
    " \n",
    "It's also important to create strong relationships with the market – this can be achieved by doing the following.\n",
    " \n",
    "(1) Creating a low price image e.g. by offering price discounts on basic products such as cement, steel bars and iron-sheets and recovering the profit margin through minor products such as door locks, hinges, sand paper and trowels.\n",
    " \n",
    "(2) By encouraging convenient shopping e.g. by allowing your trusted clients to place orders via phone, delivering to the site for free and allowing them to pay you later in the evening.\n",
    " \n",
    "(3) By providing a one stop shop for your clients such that they don’t have to go shop for anything else in any of your competitors’ shops. You may want to talk to your suppliers so that they avail any items that may be on demand but are missing from your shop as quickly as possible as you strive to achieve the status of a one-stop-shop.\n",
    " \n",
    "*4. Which Products “Move” Off The Shelves Quick?*\n",
    " \n",
    "Because hardware business is quite capital intensive – i.e. huwa inafunga pesa sana – you will want to invest mostly in fast moving products. These are;\n",
    "\n",
    "Cement\n",
    "Steel bars and rods\n",
    "Nails\n",
    "White cement\n",
    "Door hinges\n",
    "Roofing nails\n",
    "Flooring tiles\n",
    "Welding rods\n",
    "Plumbing material\n",
    " \n",
    "Please note that although products such as cement and steel bars sell quite fast, they have very slim profit margins. You can start your hardware with these basic items and then expand your inventory by adding other new products based on what your customers are frequently requesting for.\n",
    " \n",
    "*5. Marketing*\n",
    " \n",
    "Don’t make the mistake of sitting in your shop the whole day waiting for customers to walk in. With the kind of competition that’s there nowadays, you are better off getting the word out there yourself.\n",
    " \n",
    "You can hire a salesman to be going around your area scouting for any new upcoming construction sites. Field trips such as these will help you initiate fruitful relationships with site owners and foremen.\n",
    " \n",
    "Tip: When you go marketing to different customers, the first question you are most likely to get is “How much do you price cement and steel bars?” At that point, you are better off giving a price discount for these two crucial commodities even if it means recovering the cost through other products which the customer might require later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most potential customers use the price of cement and steel bars to judge how friendly your deals are – so don't make the mistake of overcharging them on these two.\n",
    " \n",
    "*6. Managing The Hardware*\n",
    " \n",
    "Hardware business requires a hands-on approach. And although it is quite possible to run it alongside an 8.am to 5.am job, you will surely need to burn the mid-night oil in order to keep track of its performance.\n",
    " \n",
    "Ideally, you should have a stock taking exercise done after every two weeks – this will help you understand which products are “moving” fast off the shelves and which ones need immediate restocking.\n",
    " \n",
    "Stock taking can also help you control possible theft by your employees; which has often been cited as one of the biggest challenges in running a hardware shop.\n",
    " \n",
    "*7. Minimum Cost Breakdown*\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting stock – Ksh.500,000 (200 bags of cement, 100 pieces of steel bars among others)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rent & Deposit – Ksh.50,000 (May vary)\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Business Permit\n",
    "\n",
    "KRA ETR Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Other Minor Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum starting budget for this SME would be Ksh.700,000\n",
    " \n",
    "*8. Profitability*\n",
    " \n",
    "On average a good performing hardware makes a net profit of 10% its daily sales. Therefore if you make a daily sale of Ksh.100,000 you can look forward to making Ksh.10,000 net profit per day. Please note that this figure may vary depending on your pricing policy and list of expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally:*\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, you should be able to start and run a profitable hardware business in Kenya. It is a profitable business and there is a high demand for its products since many Kenyans are building. \n",
    "\n",
    "Handle clients with respect and offer quality. Maintain good customer relations and they will recommend others and always come back. \n",
    "\n",

    "31/01/2022, 10:02 am - +254 742 304047: *HOW TO BECOME A REAL ESTATE AGENT IN KENYA*\n",
    "\n",
    "Becoming a real estate agent or a realtor is a great career choice – part time or full time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you love houses and properties you can consider getting into the real estate as a real estate agent. As a real estate agent/ realtor, you will assist your clients to buy, sell, or rent any type of property.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, before you go on, you don’t have to go to a college/ university to become a Real Estate Agent/ realtor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can become a real estate agent or realtor at any point in your life if you want to. But, you can’t just wake up one day and become one as you have to get licensed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although, there is a difference between a real estate agent and a realtor, they both do very similar roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a real estate agent, you are basically allowed by the government through the license to assist the public to buy, sell, or rent a property.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be realtor, you first acquire the license from the government as a real estate agent and then join a realtor association in your region. Therefore, the major difference between a real estate agent and a realtor is the association.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are in a realtor association, you are under an umbrella that covers other stakeholders in real estate. They include brokers, salespeople, property managers, etc. around the country. Every individual under the association is ruled and operates under a strict code of conduct/ ethics.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, to operate as a real estate agent or a realtor in whatever country you are in, you are required to be licensed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people associate the buying and selling of land with crooked deals because of the scandals around it, but trading in land can be good business if you understand the legal processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, many people now call themselves commission agents for land. The business offers good commissions if you successfully conclude a transaction. For example, 10 per cent commission from a land sale worth Sh1 million could earn you Sh.100,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You must know all the land transaction processes if you are to succeed in this business,” says Pius Katambo, a land agent at the Coast.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Land transactions are not difficult when all the required documents are available,” says Katambo, who has more than 20 years of experience in the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get into business as a land agent, all one needs is an office and the usual business licenses from your county government.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where land ownership documents are missing, there are procedures for getting new documents from relevant government offices. Part of the duties of a land agent is to help clients by following up on the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real estate is a rewarding career but many new agents don’t survive the first year. There are many reasons for this failure rate but number 1 is lack of patience. And the attitude to make money quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success loves those who know what they want and how they will get it. Don’t rush into making money. Sit and draw a road map. What do you want to achieve? How are you going to reach your target?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Niche down – You cannot be a Jack of all trades in real estate*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many niches in real estate. This means that you have to choose a niche. Once you have chosen your niche work to become an expert in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Become so good that clients will start talking about you for a particular service. There are 4 broad real estate niches;\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tLocation niches\n",
    "•\tSeller niches\n",
    "•\tConsumer niches\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Niche down to one niche. Focus on it. Improve your skillset and be the top expert in that niche. That is how to make money. This is because you are the guy to go to for e.g., duplexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hunt for new clients relentlessly*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day make sure to add a new prospect into your business. Clients are everything to a real estate agent. The more you prospect the better you become in finding new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tools that could help you acquire prospects regularly;\n",

    "\n",
    "When you network, you get a chance to introduce your business to your peers, new prospects, and maintain relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good idea to join as many relevant networks as you can. This way you are able to generate a steady flow of potential clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Customer service is crucial because the client is the King*\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep all communication channels open to your current and potential clients. High degrees of communication make customer retention at above-average levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "New clients are attracted to good customer service. Make sure your clients can reach you both on and offline. Respond to customer queries promptly and with the right answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some customer service tool you could use are;\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tSMS text support\n",
    "•\tLive chat\n",
    "•\tAutomatic callback\n",

    "•\tCustomer portal within your website\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember – communication is key to business success.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is the income of a real estate agent?*\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on the agreement between the agent and the property seller. Most are paid on commission. The agent sells a property and he or she earns a commission.\n",
    "\n",
    "The commission percentage ranges from 5 to 20%. This is determined by the nature of the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A piece of land is sold for 10 million. As the agent, your commission is 10%. How much is your pay in that transaction? 10% of 10 million is equal to 1 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Take real estate agent courses to improve your skillset*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need skills to excel in whatever you choose to do in life. Therefore before you begin your real estate marketing journey get trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "And after the initial training don’t stop learning. Continue taking courses to improve your knowledge and skill set. At the onset, you need at least a certificate to prove your seriousness to clients. Let people know you are trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the small courses you can do to become a successful real estate agent?\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tMarketing\n",

    "Rule number 1: Business money is not your money; even if you are a sole proprietor. There must be a clear distinction, including different bank accounts for the avoidance of doubt. Without this clear distinction, we have found that many entrepreneurs steal from their businesses to survive.\n",
    " \n",
    "This means that the company will have no ability to sustain itself or grow, leading to frustration for the entrepreneur. Now, what do I mean by stealing? If you hired a manager to do the work you do in your business would you allow them to simply take the money they need from the business the way that you do? I would guess the answer is no.\n",
    " \n",
    "“But they do not own the business and I do, there is a difference.” I hear you say. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there is, kindly let me explain. If you are directly involved in the running of the business, you are like an employee. You are a factor of production and the business needs your work to function.\n",
    " \n",
    "Therefore you need to be paid for that work, and the method of compensation for work is called a salary or wage. The salary or wage will be the cash you need to take care of all your personal needs.\n",
    " \n",
    "Paying yourself a salary or wage will also prove whether that business is profitable or not. If I build a bicycle for sale, there are costs of producing that bicycle. The first is the cost of the raw materials (metal, rubber, and plastic), let us say Ksh.3,000. The second cost is my labour.\n",
    " \n",
    "It took me 4 hours to build the bike and I had to use very specific skills to do so. My time and skill costs money, in this case Ksh.500 per hour and so the total cost of my time is Ksh.2,000 to build the bicycle.\n",
    " \n",
    "The bicycle could not have been built without labour. Therefore if I sell the bicycle for Ksh.3,000 I have made a loss because I did not account for my time and skill.\n",
    " \n",
    "Even if you are not directly involved in the production and simply manage the team, the business should pay you for your time and skill. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you do not pay yourself you tend to take money from the business randomly and as you need which leads to poor cash management and eventual business failure.\n",

    "\n",
    "You are an accounting graduate or have skills in bookkeeping and you want to get serious about starting a business then this is for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a report published by (Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK) and Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) on Drivers of Change and Future Skills in Kenya, accountancy profession and skills are and will be the most needed by businesses and institutions in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, Kenya has the largest economy in East Africa, and the accountancy profession in the country has played a key role in supporting the country’s economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, of concern are small businesses which are held back by a failure to exploit fully the skills of accountants. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where a business opportunity lies for you because some of these small businesses are side hustles mostly managed by entrepreneurs who are engaged in some full-time employment and do not have enough time to record their financial status.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, they are shy of sourcing a well-established audit firms to do bookkeeping for them as the business is still small and hiring an audit firm can even be more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, they consider hiring bookkeeping freelancers in Kenya since they are quite affordable as compared to a full-time employee as they believe they can save up to 50 per cent in business cost by hiring a bookkeeping freelancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has made bookkeeping and accounting perhaps one of the most in-demand services in town that small businesses will farm out to part-time freelancers and you can be one.\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need is your skills in bookkeeping and the ability to work with various softwares. Sometimes these skills might not be found in school but career experience where you get to learn on the job can serve better.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because these days getting an internship, whether paid or unpaid, is not easy, this is why you need to start with the small businesses where you can gather the experience and get some income to improve your skills in future maybe by registering for computerized accounting classes where you can learn the use sophisticated software such as Sun, Oracle, MC, Turnquest, Sage-Pastel and QuickBooks that bigger companies are now using.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the best and cheapest way of making yourself known by those who need bookkeeping services is via social media where you may use some little cash to place an ad and also through friends, registering with some online space such as Truelancer.com can be of great help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though, in Kenya audit firms charge Sh.430 per hour for their bookkeepers, you can charge Sh.200 per hour since most of these small businesses do not have much data to work on other than daily sales and stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this rate, you only need about 10 individuals or businesses in town and you will be sure of Sh.2,000 per day and Sh.10,000 a week assuming you work for five days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bryan Kwena, is one of the renown bookkeepers in Nairobi. He says he has been, for over 10 years worked with small business entrepreneurs just for bookkeeping services.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Most of these guys do not know how to keep their financial records and to make matters worse a good number of them are not in touch with their businesses on a daily basis, making bookkeeping a selling service in town,” said Bryan.\n",
    "\n",
    "He has about five permamnet clients whom he services on a daily basis for about three hours each and he chargers Sh.200 to Sh.400 per hour depending on the scale of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can be like him, just be a go-getter. This idea is still a soft target that you can take on. \n",

    "\n",
    "Beauty standards in the 21st Century have really changed compared to past years. Nowadays beauty treatments are not only limited to women, men too enjoy getting a professional manicure and pedicure done. This makes starting up a nail parlour a viable business idea especially if you have a passion for making people look beautiful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will help you learn how to set up a nail salon business by answering these key questions;\n",
    "\n",
    "How much money do I need to get started?\n",
    "\n",
    "What licences do I need?\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the basic equipment and items will I need and what is their approximate cost?\n",

    "How do I get started?\n",
    "\n",
    "How much profit can I make?\n",
    "\n",
    "*GETTING STARTED*\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a nail salon has its glamorous side but it’s also a lot of work. As the owner of your salon, you need to be conversant with all aspects of your business and also figure out how to make the business sustainable and maintain cash flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, before getting into the nail salon business, it is advisable to learn by actually working in one. Take up a job at a fairly successful nail salon, learn the ins and outs of successfully managing the business, find out what it is you can do differently, know what are some of the latest nail art techniques and equipment and how much revenue you can expect to make as profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any other business, you need capital to get started. The least amount you need to open up a small nail salon is Ksh.100,000 excluding licences and permits.\n",
    "\n",
    "*LOCATION*\n",
    "\n",
    "A good location is key to the success of a nail parlor. It is advisable to choose a location with high foot traffic for maximum visibility. This might set you back quite a generous amount due to high rent and a small outdoor advertisement board to help your business stand out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rent prices vary from town to town. In Nairobi, depending on the street and proximity of your space from the road, prices vary from Ksh.60,000 on the higher side to Ksh.18,000 to Ksh.10,000 on the lower side excluding goodwill.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to set aside an extra Ksh.20,000 to Ksh.30,000 to hire a carpenter and interior designer to revamp the space to fit a nail salon.\n",
    "\n",
    "*BASIC EQUIPMENT AND ITEMS TO START-UP (APPROXIMATE PRICES)*\n",
    "\n",
    "5 sets Acrylic Nail Tips – @Ksh.2,000 each\n",

    "*GET LICENCED*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will require a single business permit from your county government to operate the nail salon. The cost of it will depend on the size of your business and from an analysis from your area ward rep. A small salon will cost Ksh.5,000 – Ksh.15,000 per year to license.\n",
    "\n",
    "*GET STARTED*\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have already identified a suitable location for your nail parlor, gotten the relevant licenses, furnished your work space and bought basic equipment to start with and hired a few staff members to help you. So what’s next? It’s time to open shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do is have an effective marketing strategy that will help you get clients. This can include opening a social media business page, passing out flyers in the neighborhood, having an outdoor advert sign, having a discount for your first customers and depending on your budget, you can organize a grand opening event.\n",
    "\n",
    "*INVESTMENT VS. PROFIT*\n",
    "\n",
    "To start small, you can start with as little as Ksh.100,000 and keep re-injecting your profit as the business grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your price list and the services you offer, a nail salon can make you between Ksh.5,000 to Ksh.15,000 on a fairly busy day or even more if it serves high end clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "*FINAL WORD*\n",
    "\n",
    "Nail parlor is a wise and timely business idea that doesn’t necessarily require too much capital and has a lot of potential. In fact, research by popular beauty magazine, NailsMag suggests that 82% of nail salon goers return to get their nails done.\n",

    "01/02/2022, 5:33 pm - +254 701 711058: *HOW TO START SUPPLYING BUILDING MATERIALS IN KENYA*\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear entrepreneurs, with real estate sector, now thriving, building materials such as sand, ballast, and building stones are in great demand. Everywhere buildings are coming up as people build their homes and housing companies build estates.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start supplying stones, sand, and ballast to these projects and be part of this real estate boom. The model is simple, it involves buying and transporting these materials in order to those building houses. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will mainly concentrate on those around Nairobi and environs and on the sand, building stones and ballast, though there are many other materials you can supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Equipment*\n",
    "\n",
    "The only equipment needed for this business is a well-maintained lorry of good capacity. Many banks such as NIC Bank specialize in asset finance and can advance you some money towards the purchase of a lorry for this business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other banks can also advance you loans as long as you meet their terms and conditions. At the moment, Kenya Commercial Bank has a deal with Tata trucks where they can finance within certain terms and conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This business requires a big capacity lorry such as 7,000 tonnes and above. It also requires a well maintained or new lorry. Makes such as Isuzu are good but will cost more. Tata and Mitsubishi are equally good but mostly when new. With over Ksh.1 Million, you may get a good lorry which can start you off. A new Tata may go for Ksh.3 Million to Ksh.5 Million depending on capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are dealers who can give you a truck on down payment of anything from 50% then the rest is paid monthly for a period of 12 months, 24 months or more plus other conditions depending on the agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, if you opt to go for a used truck, be ready to have a reliable mechanic thoroughly check and test the engine before committing. In any case, don’t even think of going for a very old truck, you may never have peace of mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stones*\n",
    "\n",
    "Quarry stones are available in Lukenya, Tala, and other quarries while machine cut stones are available mostly in Juja. Many other quarries sell machine cut stones but those from Juja have been known to be more durable. Stones have various grades, quality, and sizes. You must choose the right stones depending on your customer requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ballast*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ballast (kokoto) is available from quarries in Mlolongo, Kitengela, and others. There are various sizes depending on the work to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sand*\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike stones and ballast, and is not from quarries. Many dealers mine sand from river beds in Ukambani, Kajiado, Ngong, Mai Mahiu and many other places. The buying cost of sand will depend on where it is mined from. Some dealers collect free after paying local brokers or authorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sales*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this business, good networking is very important. You may never get any business without relying on contacts. You need to develop good contacts among fundis, contractors, quarry owners, colleagues, other dealers, brokers, relatives and friends. It is through these people that you will get business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your costing will mostly be based on transportation costs to locations where the materials are to be delivered. You need to know the most cost effective location to get the materials from, bearing in mind the quality too. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, delivery of machine cut stones to places such as Syokimau, Mlolongo, Rongai, Town Centre, Westlands, Industrial Area may cost between Ksh.50 — Ksh.55 per piece depending on quantity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normal quarry stones are sold in terms of running feet. 600ft or 800ft may sell for between Ksh.25,000 to Ksh.45,000 depending again on the quarry, quality, size and location where they are to be delivered and mode of transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ballast is mostly sold for approximately Ksh.1,000 or Ksh.1,200 per tonne at the quarry. You will charge your clients inclusive of transport depending on where they are located and tonnage of your lorry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Equally, sand is sold inclusive of transport therefore, make good estimates depending on the tonnage of your lorry and fuel consumption. A 20 tonne lorry can deliver with Ksh.35,000 to areas such as Kayole or Embakasi.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Returns*\n",
    "\n",
    "The returns in this business will depend on several factors. Since the business income is mostly based on transport, the consumption of your lorry will play a major role. Old vehicles consume more fuel than new vehicles of the same engine capacity under the same load, therefore, if your lorry in much older and in poor mechanical condition, you will lose some income on fuel consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "With good contacts and connections, you can make between Ksh.30,000 and Ksh.100,000 per day on average, after paying the driver, turn-boy, county government levies, and after fueling for the next day. If you get a contract where an estate or gated community is being built, then you will literally be laughing all the way to the bank, everyday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid trouble with the police by having your lorry in good condition, with valid inspection sticker and insurance cover. If it is on loan, some banks will insist that you install a tracking device at your cost. In addition, ensure that you have made arrangements for a secure place where your lorry will be parked overnight, not far away from your area of operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial investment in this business is high, but with good connections, returns are also high, and since several financial institutions have packages that can help you acquire a lorry, why not start researching on this business now? \n",
    "\n",
    "Your research should include the location of quarries, prices of materials, lorry types and capacities, weigh bridges, financing options, contacts and other aspects of this business.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The campaign season is upon us once again (if you’re from Kenya that is) which means politicians will be spending big money on posters, t-shirts, caps and umbrellas. \n",
    "\n",
    "And beyond the campaign season; companies, governments and institutions always have projects to run and they need…. you guessed it… lot’s of promotional materials. \n",
    "\n",
    "Screen printing is arguably the most versatile of all printing processes. As a business, it can be used to print on a wide variety of items, including paper, paperboard, plastics, glass, metals, fabrics and many other materials. The screen printing process uses a porous mesh (screen) stretched tightly over a frame made of wood or metal.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can take advantage of all the opportunities like election campaigns, dance groups, choirs and chamas to start a screen printing business and print all manner of items for sale. The initial investment is huge but the potential of a screen printing business is also huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In screen printing business, your products will be printed fabrics such as t-shirts, caps or any other fabric. This business will require printing and color skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can you start a business that fulfills this exact need? Is there a lot of money involved? Let`s take a look.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How To Get Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to invest in a digital heat press machine (you can always upgrade to a more advanced machine as your business grows), a computer and a few sample materials (e.g. sample t-shirts, umbrellas etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you need to some graphic design skills which you can acquire through local trainings (consider interning at a busy printing shop to learn the best practices of this hustle). Lastly, you need good marketing and networking skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big office is not even necessary for this kind of business. We have seen companies that were started and run from verandahs and even bedrooms. The key thing is to keep marketing and get as many clients as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can particularly approach corporate clients, politicians, schools and even large public gatherings e.g. graduation ceremonies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, you need to approach suppliers of blank apparels. Whether blank t-shirts or blank umbrellas depending on what your clients want.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Screen Printing Machine*\n",
    "\n",
    "Screen printing machines come in three different categories depending on the amount of work it can do. The size also determines the price. \n",
    "\n",
    "They range from a 4-Base/station screen printing machine which is smaller and costs about Ksh.40,000, 6-Base screen printing machine which is medium and costs about Ksh.200,000 and the bigger 8-Base screen printing machine which costs about Ksh.300,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mesh stretched over a frame of wood or metal will be used to transfer the image to the fabric that is to be printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Heat Press Machine*\n",
    "\n",
    "This machine exacts pressure and heat on the fabric so that it is easier to imprint graphics and text in it. The machine goes for about Ksh.45,000 from Juakali. An imported version of the same will cost Ksh.60,000 and above. A heavy duty heat press machine will cost more than Ksh.80,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cap Printing Machine*\n",
    "\n",
    "This machine is for printing on caps and has attachments shaped like a cap to be able to fit in the caps while printing is done. This machine costs about Ksh.45,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fabrics*\n",
    "\n",
    "Clients may bring their own sets of fabrics to be printed with their own designs or for those who do not have, you will buy and print for them, depending on the type they want. Most of your clients will have the design they want to be printed on the fabric either in soft copy or hard copy from which you will make a screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very many shops along River Road, Sheikh Karume Road and many others around downtown Nairobi which sell plain cotton t-shirts of different colors. A plain round neck costs about Ksh.220 while a polo neck goes for about Ksh.450.\n",
    "\n",
    "After screen printing is done, the prices of the T-shirts will vary according to the type of color used and of course the design. It all depends on the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "All colors for any t-shirt type will cost about Ksh.150 while one color will be charged Ksh.80. These are for bulk printing only. If a client has only one T-shirt for screen printing, they are charged about Ksh.500.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Inks*\n",
    "\n",
    "The screen colors (inks) used are yellow, magenta (red), cyan (blue), black and white. Several stationery shops sell these inks at about Ksh.300 — Ksh.1,200 per kg depending on type.\n",
    "\n",
    "*T-Shirt Printing Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "You simply import plain t-shirts from China or buy locally. Then you do some design work on your computer and send it to the digital heat press machine and place your t-shirts for printing. You can charge as much as Ksh.500 per printed t-shirt depending on the quality of the shirt and it’s design.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Umbrella Printing*\n",
    "\n",
    "You acquire umbrellas on wholesale then customize them according to your client’s requirements. Depending on nature of the job, you can charge as much as Ksh.2,000 per umbrella.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Branding of Gift Items*\n",
    "\n",
    "Am talking about metallic business cardholders, cups, mugs, biro pens, diaries and so forth. You buy them on wholesale, brand them and price them in a manner that gives you some good profit margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "One mistake people make with this kind of business is they buy the machines, open an office and then sit there hoping for customers walk in. Wise businessmen however, operate by going to where their customers are. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep knocking doors and keep doing a good job for your clients. This way you will get so many referrals and your small factory will always be busy. Most importantly do a great job and customers will keep giving you additional referrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Heat press machine – Ksh.50,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Refurbished computer – Ksh.35,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Samples & Marketing budget – Ksh.15,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Miscellaneous – Ksh.10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "TOTAL BUDGET (Minimum Possible) – Ksh.110,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns may vary depending on factors such as number of years one has been in this business, quality of work, quality of clients and nature of pricing. \n",
    "\n",
    "On average, small-scale printers look forward to Ksh.200,000 in sales per month – with a net profit of 40%. But once again the figures can be higher or lower than that depending on the skills of the businessman involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Screen printing business can be very lucrative when many orders start coming in. This will only be possible after aggressive marketing and quality productions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This business has the potential to bring in Ksh.40,000 to Ksh.80,000 per day depending mostly on the amount of printing orders made, size and the type of machines used.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Payment for workers (done on daily basis)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Those surveyed had the following pay structures for their workers;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Messenger - Ksh.400 to ksh.500\n",
    "\n",
    "*Customer care assistants - Ksh.500 to Ksh.800\n",
    "\n",
    "*Designers Ksh.1,000 to ksh.1,500\n",
    "\n",
    "*Machine Operators – ksh.1,000 to Ksh.1,500\n",
    "\n",
    "*Challenges*\n",
    "\n",
    "“Each business has its challenges, how we get through is what matters”, said a marketer in screen printing business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some of the challenges one can encounter in screen printing business:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Power shortages\n",
    "\n",
    "*Water shortage\n",
    "\n",
    "*The business is seasonal\n",
    "\n",
    "*At times clients order and fail to pick a set of almost 50 t-shirts just because one is stained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Screen printing business is most lucrative during events like funerals, towards Christmas time and during election campaigns. Take advantage of these occasions and maximize on your profits. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you also target marketing companies or companies that are keen to promote their products the business can boom for your screen printing business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Extra Tips*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine this business with others like printing of posters, fliers and calendars. Also, you can capitalize on student leadership politics in Universities campaigns to drive even more sales.\n",

    "\n",
    "Do you want to save money to acquire some assets? Do you have to save money to build your own house? Do you need to keep money to be able to start your own business?\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to get your why ready. If you don`t, you won`t be able to save money, instead, you will be a money spender.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Build the attitude first, not the bank account.*\n",
    "\n",
    "I know you want to save money so that you may have a certain amount of money to buy certain things, but you see, cultivating a saving habit is like other habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have to start little (most especially when you earn very little income).\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on building the habit first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people usually think, “I am earning only Ksh.50,000 per month. I have a wife and three children. How do you want me to save money with this little income?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with such people is, when they start earning Ksh.100,000, they will still not save money and when they start earning Ksh.500,000, they will still not keep any money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this so?\n",
    "\n",
    "They lack a saving habit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving habit is like a giving habit. When you have Ksh.1,000 and you cannot give Ksh.50 to a friend in need, who told you that you will be able to give Ksh.100 when you have Ksh.10,000?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now even if your income is small, start cultivating a saving habit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don`t look at the amount you are keeping now. That`s not what is important. The number one important thing to look at is the habit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you are saving money regularly (no matter how small)\n",
    "\n",
    "What will happen is that, very soon, you will love keeping money so much that you will be addicted to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you get to this point, you don`t need anybody to inspire you to save more percentage of your income.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Get the picture of what you will have to do with the saved money.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you don`t know, let me tell you. Human being do things either to earn pleasure or to avoid pain. The only two reasons behind every of our action is either to get some pleasure or to avoid some pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do people buy cars with borrowed money even when it may be stupid to do so? Because they derive some pleasure driving a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few weeks ago, a female friend of mine told me, “I always buy things and immediately hate them”. She hates those things because she never needed them in the first place… she only bought them with the hope of deriving some pleasure in having them.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Now here is my point; If you can create a greater pleasure in your heart in association with what you will use the saved money for, you will be able to avoid spending money on things you don`t really need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes back, the woman in my life was telling me, “All the money you should have with you, you have invested it in your businesses. Now you are not having enough money”.\n",
    "\n",
    "She will be happy if I am having so much money I can spend now, but I am smarter than that. Most times I will invest the token I have, even when I know that will affect my daily living.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, how do I get courage to invest instead of spending?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I always imagine what it will mean for me to have enough money in the future. This imagination gives me pleasure (which is greater than what spending will give me)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the picture of what you want to do with the saved money gives you more pleasure than what you can get from spending your money now, you will naturally know how to save money.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Differentiate between wants and needs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "More than 50% of things we buy are wants… we don`t actually NEED them in the first place… we only want them because we see other people using or having them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you watch ladies so closely, you will see them looking at other ladies as they walk on the street. Right on their mind is communication like, “That top is beautiful on that lady, I should buy one like it”, “and this skirt is smart on this lady. It makes more men to look at her. I will buy one like it”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though these ladies have more beautiful clothes at home, you will still see them buying more… simply because they see those fashions or styles on other ladies. That`s satisfying your want, not need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some men will start planning for a new T.V just the day they see a new, fashionable T.V in their friend`s sitting room. They will feel like, “John has bought that television, it makes his sitting room more beautiful. I have to buy that T.V too”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advertising is another enemy we have. Whenever we read or listen to an advert, we instantly desire to get the pleasure the advert promises, so we start planning on how to spend our money on those things we see on the advert.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a good money saver, you have to make sure you ask yourself this question before deciding on whether to purchase something or not… do I actually need this thing? Can I live without this thing? What is the worst that will happen if I don`t buy this thing? Will it really hurt?\n",
    "\n",
    "*In Conclusion;*\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving is firstly done by consistently putting aside money. It is not a one off affair but rather a habit that is cultivated. If you earn money every month, then you should save every month. The consistency is key. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, savings are put aside in an account that is not used for day to day expenses. Never mix the two. The account you get paid into or use to withdraw every day money is not the savings account. Treat savings like a bill. When you get paid, remove it from your everyday account and transfer it somewhere else. This way you get to see it accumulate.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many people don’t like to hear the truth about themselves… especially if this truth showcases weaknesses, shortcomings and downfalls. \n",
    "\n",
    "We all like to hear words like “you are your own boss,” “you are in control of things,” “you are one step closer to personal freedom”.\n",
    "\n",
    "But while being a businessperson comes with many perks, it turns out that sometimes our very own behaviors can end up being a liability to the very businesses we are trying to build. \n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is that your personal habits could actually be the ones causing your business not to grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are 5 notorious personal habits that are quite common in Africa; and ones that could actually be taking a toll from your many years of hard work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Mixing Business With Friendship*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are the kind of person who struggles to maintain boundaries between family, friends and business, then you are likely to have a difficult time managing your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, I am sure you have heard of the old quote that goes “Mix women with business and you will see dust”.\n",
    "\n",
    "While that quote may sound sexist, it actually passes a very important message. If every time you secure a government tender you rush to get a second wife or the so-called “side dish”, then chances are that you will not go far as a businessman.\n",
    "\n",
    "It all boils down to self-discipline and the ability to draw the line between the good and the bad. Just because personal freedom is a perk that comes with entrepreneurship doesn’t mean you have the right to over-indulge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moderation is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Withdrawing Capital From Your Business To Fund Your Expensive Lifestyle*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people get into business thinking that it will solve all their personal finance problems. They get into it in order to sustain a lifestyle their white-collar or blue-collar job could not cater for.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is nothing wrong with having a strong, monetary motive for getting into business, withdrawing money recklessly from your business account just because your girlfriend has been pushing you to take her to Dubai for shopping is a big no-no.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with being in business is that no one will limit you or dictate how you handle cash. But if you want to make meaningful progress then it is imperative to limit your access to cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to go about it is by regarding yourself as an employee of your company, whereby you earn a regular salary. It may sound like a retrogressive approach but it can actually help you stabilize your cash-flow especially at the early stages of growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. You And Your Bad Manners*\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not here to lecture you on how you should behave, but if your character is the only thing standing between you and your success then we have to talk about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "How refined are your manners? Are you the kind of boss who always scolds your employees in the presence of customers? \n",
    "\n",
    "Are you the type that always runs away with suppliers’ money? Are you the type that writes bouncing cheques and then switches off the phone?\n",
    "\n",
    "Or may be you are the kind that cannot work without smoking cigarettes or drinking one for the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how ratchet your personal life is, don’t let that become a burden to your business. Consider hiring an image consultant. Better still, invest in structures, whereby you can have someone else handle delicate things like customer care, accounts and debt collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Not Being Trusting Enough*\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost everyone makes this mistake in one way or another. We sometimes get too possessive of our business to an extent that we run everything from our handbags or briefcases. \n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t want anybody else to handle the cash because you think they are going to misappropriate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t want anybody else to make key decisions in your company because you want to feel like you are in control of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therein lies the problem with most African businesses. That’s why we don’t have many businesses that have been handed down across generations for decades. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the founder dies, he goes with all his ideas and the company collapses. Isn’t that what happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to realize that the business is bigger than your ego and insecurities. The world’s best companies of our time are the ones which the founder invests in other people and let’s them play a role in organizational growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Thinking Loans Are BAD*\n",
    "\n",
    "We all grew up listening to horror stories about loans. How Mr. So and So took a loan to start a dairy farm only for his business to be auctioned and left bankrupt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or How Mrs. So and So developed high blood pressure due to the frequent sighting of debt collectors near her village shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality though, loans are not all that bad. You only need to take them for the right reason and with the right motive. Sometimes a bit of loan financing is all it takes to overcome those primary cash-flow challenges that cause 80 percent of start-ups to fold up in less than two years.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "As Warren Buffet once put it, chains of habits are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken. \n",
    "\n",
    "So could it be that your habits are getting in the way of your business success but you are too busy to notice? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that’s for you to figure out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, don`t forget to join our Investing in Stocks Training. \n",

    "\n",
    "Even before you start a business or sell any product, the first thing to consider is your market audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "For there to be success in the market place, your product/service must meet customers. Not just customers, but customers who value what you’re selling and who are willing to pay for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes a small business owner or entrepreneur may have a very good product or service, but because the market he is trying to sell to doesnt value what he/she is offering he will not make much money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes back I spent a day with a good friend of mine who is a poet (the best poet I have ever met). He writes so many poems and I love reading his work.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we conversed together, I asked him, “Who is your audience?” In other word, “who are those who actually value what you have to offer?” \n",
    "\n",
    "His answer was not encouraging because we are living in a world where most youths and adult dont appreciate poetry. What most people do in our day is to spend hours on T.V, movie, football etc. Especially in Africa, only few people read good books.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a poem in Kenya with the aim of making alot of money from it may not be successful. Its like giving bread to dogs. It may not eat much of it.\n",

    "04/02/2022, 12:00 pm - +254 742 304047: *BUSINESSES YOU CAN START WITH KSH.5,000*\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often, we tend to underestimate the power of money that is in our grasp. Instead of swallowing the humble pie and starting small, we wait perpetually for bigger amounts so that we can do big things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this BIG money dream does not always come true and so we get stuck at the same financial state forever…and the cycle of poverty continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today I would like to show you just how much power Ksh.5,000 has. If you invest it wisely, you can build an empire with it. But if you choose to spend it, then you can as well buy a few snacks and drinks with it and make merry. The choice is yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Invest in unit trusts*\n",
    "\n",
    "Under unit trusts, you approach an investment company such as Britam, Genghis Capital or Old Mutual. You give them your Ksh.5,000 and allow them to invest it on your behalf. In turn, the investment company will add your money to their pool of resources (where other investors have put their money as well) and appoint a fund manager for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the year you can get decent returns for it – depending on how well the fund you invested in performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best thing about unit trusts is that you can start saving from as little as Ksh.500 per month. Moreover, you can receive sound financial advice from the investment company which you can then use to improve your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Invest in a Sacco*\n",
    "\n",
    "Investing your money in a SACCO will enable you to borrow up to three times what you saved. This means if you save Ksh.5,000 you can borrow up to Ksh.15,000 to do a further investment such as starting a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, your Ksh.5,000 will enable you to leverage and access good debt for investment purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hire a Laptop, Pay for Internet and Start Online Freelancing*\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Online Freelancing? Freelancing basically involves finding some online jobs and doing them for a pay. For instance, if you are good at graphic design you can look for online jobs on a site like freelancer.com. If you are good at video transcribing you can look for freelancing assignments on sites like oDesk.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re good at writing you can check out sites like kuhustle.co.ke, fiverr.com or even freelancer.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have some Ksh.5,000 and lots of free-time, why not invest in freelancing business by simply hiring a laptop and paying for internet for up to one month?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Start a Blog*\n",
    "\n",
    "The job of a blogger is to write articles that attract people to their blogs. The more traffic your blog gets, the more the business you can derive from it. For instance, you can apply for Google Adsense monetization program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can sell your blog’s advertising space or endorse other people’s products for a commission. In this regard, you can use your Ksh.5,000 to purchase a domain and pay for web hosting for your blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Write and sell eBooks*\n",
    "\n",
    "If blogging doesn’t sound like a good idea to you then you may want to consider writing eBooks and selling them on online retail sites such as Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing. Each time your eBook is downloaded you get royalties (70 percent royalty or 35 percent royalty depending on set policies).\n",
    "\n",
    "The more your eBooks are downloaded the more income you get. The best thing about writing eBooks as opposed to blogs is that you can receives royalties for your work for as long as your Books are downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Buy airtime scratch cards in wholesale and re-sell*\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you are not a good writer. Or maybe even you don’t know how to use a computer. Then how about buying airtime scratch cards wholesale and re-selling it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the profit margins are not as wide as you would expect, there is still some money that can be made in this business. In addition to scratch cards you can re-sell newspapers. Most newspaper companies give up to Ksh.7 commission for each paper sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mobile food delivery*\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you a good cook? Can you make some nice snacks? Then why not start a small food delivery business with the little capital you have? \n",
    "\n",
    "You can particularly target middle-income corporate workers who work in high-end suburbs where there are no affordable sources of decent food.Alternatively, you can supply food to workers in construction sites. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a bit of effort and good marketing, the opportunities for this kind of business are unlimited.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Office supplies*\n",
    "\n",
    "With the devolved system of governance in the country, most up-country towns are growing very fast. Big companies and start-ups are setting up offices there. Your opportunity in this case lies in marketing things like plastic staff ID cards, rubberstamps and even business cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you can source for business cards in Nairobi for Ksh.2 per piece and supply them upcountry for Ksh.8 per piece after designing them and printing them. If you don’t have a good printer for the job you can outsource printing services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The secret to succeeding in this business lies in good marketing and building customer loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Supply stationery to remote areas*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most schools in the rural areas have short supply of stationery – school revision papers, printing papers, diaries etc. On the other hand, town areas like Nairobi have an over-supply of these products.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an innovative businessman, you can think about sourcing for stationery for cheap prices in towns and delivering them to schools in rural and remote areas at a profit. You can further market your products during head teacher’s meetings which takes place at regional and national levels annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start small with a few schools and keep growing bit by bit as your capital expands.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final word*\n",
    "\n",
    "I can go on and on. Clearly, there are many ways to invest Ksh.5,000 provided one is willing to think outside the box. The most important qualities needed in this case are patience, good marketing skills and ability to spot opportunities where others see impossibilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "Today is Friday, let’s relax a little and learn something.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do people love Fridays?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are more people happy on Friday than on Monday?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do people say, “thank God it’s Friday”?\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone will tell me it’s because Friday marks the beginning of weekend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, let me disagree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why most people love Fridays is because it marks the end of hustling and struggling of the work place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have I told you before?\n",
    "\n",
    "A survey outcome has it that over 92% of people HATE their jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You now see why they love Friday!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real sense of it, life becomes horrible if you hate your job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you have to spend the most part of your life at the work place.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see anyone who (truly) loves his work, he’s not happier on Friday than he is on Monday.\n",
    "\n",
    "That should be your goal, and my goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have not attained it all. I have not arrived. I’m not swimming in money, but I’m moving fast ahead, trying to have a better financial life.\n",
    "\n",
    "I just must love every day of my life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yea, life is hectic and tough, yet, we can strive to choose a business or profession we love.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "No one-sided answer, but maybe starting your own business or choosing a new profession will give you a better life.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think being a business owner will make you happier, then FIGHT to be an entrepreneur.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the word FIGHT above because that’s what it takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know you trust me. I wouldn’t want to tell you, “Hey, it’s easy to make a lot of money!” That’s a white lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "One great problem with our culture is that we love freedom but we don`t know how free men got their freedom. Freedom is not free. Freedom comes after a fight. If we cannot fight, we cannot be freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it`s your duty to think. Are you happy with your job or it`s like a prison to you?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are happy with your job and it`s paying your bills, you may not really need to be a business owner. Yes, you may not become a millionaire, but do you actually have to become a millionaire before you will be successful?\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success is more of who you are than what you have. A man/woman who enjoys his/her job is a king because his/her job has become his/her hobby. Spending 8 to 10 hours daily on a “hobby” is a life indeed. That`s a success… for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the reverse is the case, if you hate going to work, if your job makes you sad, if you love Fridays more than Monday, life could actually be like a prison. Just as spending 8 hours daily on your hobby makes you feel great, spending 8 hours in prison makes you feel like a slave.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have tasted both sides and I can tell you that success is doing what you love doing, even if you don`t have millions in your bank account.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will rather do what I love doing daily and eat two times a day (because I am poor), than to do what I hate and have extra one million shillings in my account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you hate Mondays?\n",
    "\n",
    "You have got to think hard on how you can hate Fridays instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "What profession do you think will make you happy every working hour?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is not usually the hardest to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardest question to answer is, are you willing to do whatever you have to do (fight) to pursue that dream profession or business that will make you happy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, as you think about it, don't forget to join our Investing in Stocks training. We only have 2 days remaining.\n",

    "At a time when my mates were sleeping 8 to 9 hours, I was FORCING myself to sleep 4 to 5 hrs. \n",
    "\n",
    "But why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I needed power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know that there is a close relationship between power and prosperity?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what I mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can’t be rich if you are not powerful. And you can’t be powerful and not be rich.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. People who have mighty businesses.\n",

    "4. And the kings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Also some TOP employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you think about it! All these people are powerful, that’s why they are rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business people are in control of hundreds of people (employees) and thousands if not millions of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Famous people (e.g. footballers, musicians) have thousands of raving fans who love them and can die for them (and that means they are in control of them).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can’t be rich, unless you are powerful. The more power you have, the richer you will become\n",

    "Guess what? Every power is used over people. That is how the tittle of this article goes; “Power, People, Prosperity.”\n",

    "Dangote the richest African from Nigeria has over 20,000 employees (as at when writing this) and millions of people who consume products from his business. \n",
    "\n",
    "That makes him so powerful (and rich). For him to have more money, he MUST increase the number of his employees (and the numbers of people who like his products)\n",
    "\n",
    "Michael Jackson was famous, he had millions of fans. This made him to be very rich. If any musician, footballer, artist or actor will ever be rich, he/she must increase the numbers of people who are his/her fans. This will increase his power and the more power he/she has, the more prosperity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kings, rulers and military generals are rich, simply because they are in control of many people. The more the numbers of people a king (or general) rules, the more power he has and the more prosperity he has. That's why being a governor in Nairobi county can make you more powerful and prosperous that being a governor in Wajir county.\n",

    "Maybe you don’t understand me?\n",

    "To be rich, don’t look for money. Look for *power*\n",

    "I’m not talking about physical or political power here. I’m talking about mental power that leads to power over people.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can`t make a lot of money in business if you are not powerful. Power to win People (either for your product or political ambition) leads to Prosperity\n",

    "\n",
    "How can you get more people to love your product/services? What can you do today to get more people to fall in love with your political ambition? How can you employ and engage more people to work for you?\n",

    "\n",
    "How do we get more power? How do we get more people to fall in love with our products, services or political ambition?\n",
    "\n",
    "By knowing far more than them. If you are in politics your goal is to know far more things about politics, history, your territory`s economy, human persuasion, public speaking, leadership etc. More than anyone who could be your opposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you know more than your opponents, the electorates will see you as a more competent candidate. This buys more people to your ambition and gives you more power.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a business man, your goal is to know far more than your competitors about marketing, leadership, negotiation, branding, and many other business and financial skills. If you know more about business than your competitors, you will apply your business skills in the market place and win more market share.\n",

    "05/02/2022, 5:33 pm - +254 701 711058: *HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF LAND BUYING AND SELLING BUSINESS?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In almost every community in Kenya, owning a piece of land has been a coveted investment and with increasing population, this has become even more urgent. The desire (or is it lust) by every Kenyan to own land or a home has reached alarming proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Kenyan now wants to own a home and stop paying rent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a land buying business can be a very lucrative venture. Demand for land for farming, building a home or just for speculation is very high all over the country. You can make a kill by buying land and selling off after some time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Land prices will always appreciate due to this unsustainable demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What you need*\n",
    "\n",
    "Land buying and selling business is very easy to start. You will not need any equipment. In fact you can even start without an office. What you will need is enough cash to buy the land. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your profit margins will be much higher if you buy in big acreage and sell in smaller plots. You may choose to register a company or just do it as an individual, any can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need a good lawyer. Please don’t just engage a lawyer because he is a “lawyer”. Look for a lawyer who is experienced and conversant with conveyance matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are matters relating to land laws, transfers, succession, land boards etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Operation*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I proceed further, may I add that you will be safer dealing with land that has a title deed, one that is duly registered by Ministry of Lands. This is the most recognized form of ownership of land in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try and avoid land that has no original title deed. Do not entertain documents such as allotment letters, share certificates or such like documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may regret later.\n",
    "\n",
    "This land buying and selling business is very simple. What you have to watch out for is fraud and inflated prices. Land has no standard price, the prices will mostly depend on demand, location, developments, rumour, fear, seller circumstances and many other factors which you should acquit yourself with.\n",
    "\n",
    "This business has many con-men and con-women, so be on the look out always. Always verify every information and documents that you come across or you are presented with. Never trust any seller, do all background checks and searches yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I said earlier, buy large portions and sell smaller portions. Scout for land in counties such as Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu and others and buy large portions such as 1 acre, 5 acres, 10 acres, 50 acres or even 100 acres, depending on your budget. \n",
    "\n",
    "Engage a reliable land surveyor to confirm the size, locate the beacons and identify the piece of land in the larger map of the area. This will be to ensure that you are buying land that exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having confirmed the actual existence of the land on the ground and on the map, it may be safer to confirm with the neighbors and the local administration or county officials that the land is not earmarked for any public utility or is under any dispute. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure the number on the map corresponds with the number on the title deed. Confirm also that the names and ID number of the seller is exactly the same as it appears on his or her ID, otherwise, you may regret later.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must then do a search of records at the local lands office to confirm ownership and details that are on the title deed such as names of seller and identification number and also if there is any charge on the title, such as a bank loan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure you are satisfied with all the details as recorded at the land registry and on the title.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that the original title deed is available, NOT just a copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step will be to discuss the offer price, negotiate and agree on a fair price with the original true owner of the land. This is where your lawyer will come in to draw a legal agreement between you and the seller. \n",
    "\n",
    "This agreement will detail the identities of the seller and buyer, the sell price, mode and date of payment, size and location of the land and any other information necessary to complete the transaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to appear before the land board to get consent for transfer, depending on the land and location. You may send a representative such as the lawyer to represent you.\n",
    "\n",
    "After taking possession of the land, engage your surveyor to sub-divide the big portion into smaller sizes, preferably 1/8 (50 x 100). \n",
    "\n",
    "You will then aggressively advertise these portions for sale. It will be more profitable to sell them in these smaller sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 5 acre block of land in Lukenya area just off Mombasa Road behind Dayster University goes for between Sh.5 million and Sh.6.5 million as at March 2021. This is in Machakos\n",
    "County. \n",
    "\n",
    "A 5 acre block should produce more than 30 plots of 1/8 acre after taking care of feeder roads since each plot must have a road access. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a plot of 1/8 in the same area goes for between Sh.350,000 and Sh.400,000 depending on the accessibility and seller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combined lawyer and surveyor fees should not exceed Sh.60,000. You can do the math and decide for yourself whether it will be profitable or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also opt to go for 1 acre and divide into smaller plots. Other areas such as Kamulu, Isinya, Kiserian, Namanga or Machakos Junction are also good areas where you can get big chunks of land at fair prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advertising the plots for sale will be very important. You may need to print out brochures and distribute to potential buyers, you may engage brokers at a small fee, you can also advertise in the classified sections of daily newspapers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classified sites like like jiji.co.ke, pigiame.co.ke e.t.c and social media influencers can be used to help you advertise and sell the plots quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The faster you sell off the plots and get back your money the better for your business. Therefore put serious effort in ensuring that you sell off all the plots quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Location will determine the level of interest potential buyers will show. Most buyers want developed areas and with good accessibility, come rain or shine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be prepared to take potential buyers to your land to view for themselves and confirm whatever they want. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will transfer the title of each plot to the buyer after payment. You can offer installment payments to attract more buyers. Installment payments should attract a higher price though.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages of this business*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Profit margins can be very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The price of land will always appreciate even if you don’t get buyers immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Demand of land is at its highest in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Easy to start, you may not need an office.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages of this business*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Many con-men and con-women have infiltrated land business.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sometimes it may take long to get buyers for all the plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no doubt that land business all over Kenya is lucrative. Many simple businessmen and women have become millionaires in a very short time by buying and selling land. \n",
    "\n",
    "You too can make it to become a millionaire, although it is not a get rich quick scheme. You can’t be a millionaire overnight. \n",
    "\n",
    "What you need most is to carry out independent due diligence, involve professionals such as lawyers, surveyors etc. and you will increase your chances of succeeding.\n",

    "06/02/2022, 2:35 pm - +254 701 711058: *START A LIQUID DETERGENT BUSINESS*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every home and business need detergents for cleaning. The demand for cleaning detergents has been steadily rising as more households and businesses come up. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is good news for aspiring entrepreneurs because it is possible to make these detergents and take advantage of this demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Liquid detergent as the name implies, is simply soap in liquid form. Home made liquid detergents have become popular and increased competition in the soap industry which was traditionally dominated by bar soap and other factory manufactured detergents. \n",
    "\n",
    "One reason being that liquid detergents are more versatile and multi-purpose. They can be used for various tasks such as washing dishes, clothes, floors, windows, cars and almost all other uses. This has made them very popular in homes and businesses such as hotels and restaurants, offices, car wash yards and even schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are also very easy to make. You can make liquid detergents and sell to schools, homes, hotels, car wash yards and other businesses that clean. \n",
    "\n",
    "Making liquid detergent is very simple and requires very few items. With a little training and experience, almost anybody can make these detergents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, soap is made by combining fats and oils with a chemical (Sodium Hydroxide, also known as ‘Caustic Soda’). Caustic Soda is a white solid substance that easily dissolves in water. It is available on the open market where it is often sold as pellets, granules or flakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the effect you want to achieve, you could include interesting stuff like herbs, honey and other substances that are known to soothe, smooth and heal the skin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the ingredients you need to make detergent, there are basic tools that you will need too. They are so basic that they are easily available all over. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need simple items such as bowls and spoons, buckets, wooden ladle and packaging containers for your finished product. With a budget of about Ksh.2,000 you should have these items.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Detergent Ingredients*\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these ingredients have complicated chemical names but we will use their common trade names. The ingredients should cost you about Ksh.1000 – Ksh.2,000 and can be bought from chemical shops all over town, Kariobangi light industries or industrial area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity of the chemicals are bought according to the quantity of detergent you want to make. If you want to make 100 litres, just ask the dealer to give you ingredients for that quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detergent making is a chemical process and may be a danger to your safety. Remember to use hand gloves to protect your skin from coming into contact with the chemicals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mixing Instructions*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pour the Ungerol in the container that you intend to use preferably with a capacity of 50 litres or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add Ufacid, industrial salt and caustic soda and mix with the wooden spoon until the salt is completely dissolved and the mixture is smooth and fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add more water and stir further to make the paste more dilute. Ensure you add water in small quantities to prevent too much foaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add colour and perfume or fragrance and continue stirring to the required thickness. You can use lemon drops as fragrance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once thickened, pour the mixture into a clean container and set aside for about 2 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be slight variations to these instructions depending on the type or quantity of liquid detergent you intend to produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Packaging*\n",
    "\n",
    "When your detergent is ready for the market, you have to make a decision on what packaging quantities and designs you will use depending on your market. \n",
    "\n",
    "Plastic containers come in various sizes such as 300ml, 500ml, 1L, 5L, 10L, 20L or more. Most detergent making businesses prefer the 10L or more containers since they are more popular with businesses such as hotels and restaurants, car wash yards, schools, churches and other businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Households mostly buy in smaller quantities of 500ml, 1L and 5L. Empty plastic containers can be bought in shops in town and industrial area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branding the containers with your contact details can be a good idea especially for marketing. Print labels of different sizes and stick to the containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sales and Marketing*\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquid detergent business is very simple to start and start up costs are also very low. The major task is in marketing the products. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your marketing plan should involve visiting schools, churches, households, businesses, shops and offices around you to tell them about your products.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good strategy is to make small samples and distribute to potential clients for free with your contact as you tell them about your products. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are likely to face stiff competition therefore, put a lot of effort in marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packaged liquid detergents have the following average market prices;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ksh.25 – Sh.40 (500ml)\n",
    "2. Sh.250 – Sh.300 (5L)\n",
    "3. Sh.450 – Sh.500 (10L)\n",
    "4. Sh.1,000 (20L)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bear in mind that these figures are estimates from several dealers and may vary depending on location, who is selling and who is buying. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use popular flavors such as lavender, lemon and mixed fruit to sell more. Quality should also be upheld by making properly concentrated detergent to attract and retain customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many liquid detergent sellers make profits of about Sh.1,000 – Sh.5,000 per day and make products 3 to 4 times per week but get more orders at the end of the month. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a day most make and sell between 20L to 30L of detergent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of liquid making is tedious and requires patience and passion. Make sure you have gathered enough information before you set up your liquid detergent business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, don`t forget to join our Investing in Stocks training that shall be starting tomorrow.\n",

    "\n",
    "We get into business with different motives. However, because entrepreneurship is a jungle of sorts only the very best survive as the weak ones are easily eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics show that 80% of businesses in operation today will fail in the next 5 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what makes some entrepreneurs better than others? What type of entrepreneur are you? I would like to present to you 6 types of entrepreneurs and how they cope with challenging times.\n",
    "\n",
    "*a. Survivalists*\n",
    "\n",
    "They were forced by circumstances to become entrepreneurs. For instance, they finished college or high school, tried looking for jobs but weren’t lucky enough. Because they had to find means of survival, they moved on to the world of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "They simply sell to survive. If they are lucky to get an employment opportunity, they normally quit entrepreneurship and off they go into the formal economy. Most of their businesses don’t live to see their second birthdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "*b. The Copycats*\n",
    "\n",
    "A good number of us belong to this category and that is why we are often caught up in pyramid schemes and scams. We see the success of others and try to emulate it so as to ride in the tide as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "A copycat will say “Mr. Juma is making good money selling quail eggs. I will also start keeping quails in large numbers and share the market with him.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, sadly most copy-cats lose their money within the first year of operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few who are lucky to survive and those are the ones who dare to “remodel” the idea instead of merely copying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*c. Jack of All Trades*\n",
    "\n",
    "They hunt for a shilling from every possible business opportunity. You’ll find them owning a chemist, a money transfer shop, LPG gas retail outlet, milk shop etc. all under one roof.\n",
    "\n",
    "They operate with the notion that if one business department fails then they will rely on the other one to carry on. They will sell anything as long as there is money to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "They however find difficulties surviving beyond ten years as scaling and adapting to changes in technology becomes a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "*d. Social Entrepreneurs*\n",
    "\n",
    "These entrepreneurs emerge where a social need needs to be met. In Kenya where the government service delivery fails, the needs of people remain and social entrepreneurs attempt to meet these needs through products and services that they offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their business will survive for as long as the problem(s) exists or at least until the government fills up the gap. Social entrepreneurs can survive for eternity provided they keep up with the changing dynamics of society.\n",
    "\n",
    "*e. The Opportunists*\n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurs who belong to the opportunists’ class have their DNA wired to sniff out well-timed money making opportunities. They know how to jump in at the right time and jump out at the peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are very quick decision makers – a trait that often serves them well or acts as their source of demise at times. They have to keep sniffing around for emerging opportunities to survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their life-span ranges from as brief as 1 week to eternity – depending on the prowess of the opportunity spotter.\n",
    "\n",
    "*f. The Innovators*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most innovators become entrepreneurs when in the process of doing something they love a business idea pops up around them. They measure the success of their business not by how much money they make but by the impact their products brings to man-kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll often hear them say “I would do this for free for the rest of my life if I could.” Picture Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates and you will see innovator DNA in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Innovators will survive for as long as no one else comes up with another better innovation to push them out of the market. Businesses started by innovators are by far the most secure ones although quite a few still don’t live to see their second birthdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",

    "For bigger organizations with several offices, you can charge as much as Ksh.50,000 and above. For property owners, you can offer to clean the whole building on a contract. For such properties, charges such as Ksh.100,000 and above can apply depending on the size of the building and the number of floors.\n",

    "With good network and aggressive marketing, there is good money to be made in this business idea in Kenya. \n",

    "An advantage of the cleaning business is that you can operate from home, as long as there is enough space to keep your cleaning tools and machines. \n",

    "\n",
    "All homes have electrical gadgets and machines of all types, such as television sets, radios, fridges, iron boxes, cookers, air conditioners, microwaves, computers and many others. Businesses have machines that use electrical energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "These appliances need service and repair every now and then and with the number of homes and businesses ever increasing, an appliance repair business has a very huge potential to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many homes will have breakdowns on these equipment once in a while, same to the machines in businesses and other organizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up this appliance repair business will therefore be a good idea since you will have lots of opportunities. Household gadgetry\n",
    "and automation are expanding, ensuring a future revenue stream for people who are able to repair them.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tools*\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with your knowledge in electronics and electrical engineering, starting this busyness is very simple. All you will need are simple tools such as screw drivers, pliers (long nosed and normal type), cutters, soldering gun and soldering iron/wire, a set of spanners (get the common small range such as 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19 MM). \n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t start with big sizes. Appliance repair jobs do not need those. Big sizes are mostly used for mechanical engineering jobs. You will also need a tester and a small voltage meter. Remember the screw drivers should be of various sizes, small, big and medium, both star and flat\n",
    "(sometimes called ‘minus’).\n",
    "\n",
    "With a budget of about Ksh.15,000 – Ksh.25,000, you can buy these tools and remember to go for quality tools to avoid going back to the shop after a few jobs. \n",
    "\n",
    "These tools will be enough to start you off in your appliance repair jobs but you can buy more with time as you proceed with the business. Later when your budget allows, you can look for a complete professional toolbox with many other tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your tools well and treat them with care since your business will depend on them. Without the right tools, or if they are faulty, you will be greatly limited in your ability to successfully accomplish the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Marketing*\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in any other business, marketing is a very important aspect of this appliance repair business. Do not sit back and wait for those with broken down equipment to call you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are that they may not even know that you exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go out and tell people including your neighbours, friends, relatives and even strangers that you are in appliance repair business. Print out business cards and place them in local shops, businesses and homes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Form partnership with used appliance dealers and appliance shops and ask them to refer those who need a service technician to you. You can also post advertisements in shopping malls and other areas with high foot traffic for maximum exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word of mouth will also be a very good form of marketing in appliance repair business. Just do a good job, be courteous, honest, punctual, flexible, keen, organized and cheerful and your customers will spread the good news about you. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good idea to have simple spares such as fuses, fuse wires, extra wires, screws and nuts which you can use whenever necessary. This will reduce the time it takes to carry out some of these repair jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Income*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this appliance repair business, your income will come from the fee you charge for repair and service of appliances and other gadgets. You should come up with a suitable form of charging for your labour. Your charges will depend on the appliances repaired and if there are spare parts to fix, you should include the cost of these in your fee, if you buy them with your money. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the best way is to have the client buy the spares as per your\n",
    "recommendations and just charge for labour. Some may give you money to buy the spares.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common method of charging for these repairs is by assessing the work required and coming up with a fixed figure, say Ksh.5,000 or Ksh.2,000 or whatever amount depending on the work involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rule of thumb is; charge more for more expensive appliances and less for cheaper appliances. Allow room for negotiations as well, don’t be\n",
    "too rigid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing with these repairs is that some can take a very short time, even 10 – 20 minutes. It could just be a blown fuse, a broken or loose connection or a simple short circuit that earns you Ksh.500 or ksh.1,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a good network and get a number of such jobs a day, you could earn a decent income by the end of the day or week.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages of this business*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The business is flexible and you may not need fixed premises. You can work 24 hours since most of the work will either be at your client’s home or at your home.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Business is assured since more and more gadgets and appliances are being bought in homes and businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Very little capital is required to set up the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disadvantages of this business*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Possibility of injuries while using work tools or transporting heavy appliances plus exposure to electrical shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. More consumers are replacing rather than repairing broken appliances because it’s often cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Some tasks may need very specialized equipment that may not be readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have the qualifications or engineering skills, you can still start this business and employ qualified people to work for you while you deal with marketing and business management aspects of your business.\n",

    "\n",
    "Advertising is a persuasive marketing communication from a company, organization or persons with the intention of getting a particular audience to take certain action or to continue in particular action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advertising is usually having a commercial motive behind, though there may be some adverts which are non-commercial. Most adverts are either from a company, a political party, an interest group or other commercial organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advertising, just like most other things has been in the world with us for as long as the world itself. As we advance, so do the ways by which we advertise ourselves, philosophies and businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ancient China has what is known as oral advertising of bamboo flutes played to sell candy (as recorded in the classic of poetry in around 11th to 7th centuries BC)\n",
    "\n",
    "There was also Indian rock art painting which could be traced back to 4000 BC.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several medium by which advertisement gets to the target audience. We have Newspaper, Radio, Billboard, Television, Magazine, Direct mail, Text messages, Social media, Blog, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The medium of advertisement a business/company chooses depends on what it is offering and its target audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, advertising has advanced in terms of mediums and messages. For example if you were talking about advertising in the early 80s, you wouldn`t be talking about blog, social media or text messages. You as well would not be talking about several creativity and innovation copywriters have brought in to the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people are of the opinion that the tobacco innovative advertising of the year 1920 marked the beginning of modern advertising. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the year 2021, $963 billion is estimated to be spent on advertising worldwide. This shows how advertising is more important today than it has ever been.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why is advertising that important to a business, organization or interest group? Because the competition in all fields or industries is becoming tougher by the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could produce an average product 100 years ago and become a millionaire without a single marketing or promotion. You could render a good service in the last 50 years and become rich with just a little advertisement. \n",
    "\n",
    "In today`s world, average products/services do not sell, good products/service do not sell much and even great products/services need smart marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can talk about branding, packaging, positioning and many other elements of marketing, but they are all “insiders”. The only thing that takes you to the minds and hands of your target audience is advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may brand your business, position yourself smartly and brand your products/services and still not sell enough to make your business profitable, if there isn`t good advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may ask me, can every business advertise?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, even small businesses at the village, as I will share with you in the tips below.\n",
    "\n",
    "*First think about your positioning.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Even before thinking of advertising your products/services, you have to invest a lot of thoughts into your position in the market place. Do you have any unique strength you are known with by your market? Is your product/service in anyway different than that of your competitors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have a better product, faster service or more professional staff?\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to first sit down and see something in your product/service that is unique and makes your offer more valuable than that of your competitors. \n",
    "\n",
    "After discovering this strength in what you are selling, the next thing is to position yourself as “the business” that fills that gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give you an example on how a company does this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bamburi Cement is having a position which is, “3x stronger”. By this, Bamburi is positioning its cement as stronger (better) than those of its competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you have to be careful of here is that, your claim must be true or else your marketing effort will fail. If Bamburi Cement is not (truly) stronger and the company claims it does, it`s just a matter of time before consumers will know and that`s going to be a big failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Position yourself as a better product/service in a way, then…\n",
    "\n",
    "*Invest much time on your branding and packaging*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I said earlier that branding and packaging are “inside thing”. However, it`s what you have inside that you want to take outside. The truth is, people still judge the book by its cover. \n",
    "\n",
    "If what you`re selling is not well packaged or you don`t create a good brand for your business, your advertising and other marketing efforts will not be successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Find out who your real customers are.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Who are those who need what you are selling? Where do they live? How is their daily activities like? Where do they work, school or play? How can they be best reached?\n",
    "\n",
    "The more you know about those you want to sell to, the better your marketing message will be because you will know what language, slang or communication style they can best react to.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Let your customers advertise your products/services for free*\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the beginning of the world, there has been various fashions of word of mouth advertising, whether for products, services or individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bible, when Nathanael saw Philip (John 1:45), he said, “We have found the Messiah”. That`s the word of mouth advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human beings are so good and kind that when they have a good experience with certain product or service, they love to tell their friends and relatives about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We all do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few days ago I was talking with a friend on phone. He doesn`t like Safaricom. I am one of the most loyal customers of Safaricom and I love to promote Safaricom whenever I am opportune to, so I started persuading my friend to become a regular Safaricom customer. At a point, he told me, “don`t advertise to me”.\n",
    "\n",
    "I immediately understood what I was doing… word of mouth advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "One free (and very effective) promotion you can do for your product is the word of mouth advertisement. How can you do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Encourage your customers to talk to others about your product/service. Give them something as reward if need be. And…\n",
    "\n",
    "*Produce/sell a truly great product/service.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As I earlier mentioned, the era of average products is gone. The era of good products is going. For any business person to actually make a lot of money in today`s highly competitive market, he/she must take to the market, something truly unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot sell an average product through word of mouth advertisement. You cannot sell a good service through the word of mouth advertisement. Until people can say “wow” about what you offer, they won`t be willing to tell anybody about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A creative product/service can easily be marketed through the word of mouth advertisement. That`s why you have to offer something truly great or unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Don`t advertise your products/services. Advertise your USP.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you are about to put together some marketing messages on your signboard, billboard, poster, or radio, TV, newspaper, social media, blog or whatever other medium you choose, you have to advertise your Unique Selling Promise (USP), not your product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other businesses are selling what you are selling. For example you wouldn`t write on your signboard, “buy bread here”. That`s not persuasive, is it? What if we use, “buy low-sugar, but sweet bread here”? Now, you are sounding unique and persuasive. For people who know that sugar is bad for their health, you are the man.\n",
    "\n",
    "You wouldn`t want to advertise your hospital on the newspaper by saying, “get hospital services at so and so address”. Instead, something like “we are malaria specialists. Come to our hospital at…” may be more persuasive.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am sure you get my point. Don`t tell the world about your product, hundreds of products like yours are already in the market. The only thing that can persuade people to buy from you is your Uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advertise benefit or solution, not your products/services.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Who actually cares about what you are selling? You and some of your employees. Nobody else does. The reason why consumers want to buy a particular product or service is because it solves their problem or because buying it benefits them in a certain way(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "For your marketing message to be persuasive, it must not talk about what you are selling. It must talk about how what you are offering will make people`s life better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sky Bank of Nigeria had a wonderful advert that won some cool awards (I think) few years ago. That advert features an assumed customer who says, “I wish I had a friend, to help me grow every day”. Then there is a slogan, “saying yes to your dream.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Sky Bank didn`t advertise banking, they advertised benefit.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the beginning of this year, cooking oil has become a luxury for many broke and struggling Kenyans as the price of the commodity continues to go up as a result of a rally in edible oil cost globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers now opt for salad oil that comes in barrels and is sub-divided into smaller quantities in many shops. The customers carry their containers for the quarter, half, a full litre of cooking oil they wish to buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even this is no longer affordable for many given most shops at the moment sell a litre of the salad oil at Sh.200 averagely from Sh.150 it used to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most hit with the prices are those who run businesses that need much of this oil such as potato chips, fish frying, mandazi, bajia and samosa among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, creating a fortune out of this hike and helping some of these businesses continue running at lower cost by giving an equal alternative is Michael Oketch, a pork lard seller along the busy Jogoo Road. \n",
    "\n",
    "“I started by opening a pork butchery early last year and selling meat to customers but with time, I began receiving inquiries for pork oil from some buyers something which triggered my thoughts into how this could also be some source of income,” said Michael.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, he could go to his usual abattoir in the outskirts of Nairobi and after buying his usual pork meat, he would ask for oily parts which to his surprise were sold at very lower prices compared to the ordinary parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I found that a kilo of the fatty parts was sold at Sh.50 while a kilo of normal pork meat cost Sh.300. So, for the first time I bought 10 kilos of the fatty parts at Sh.500 which gave me about seven litres of oil selling at Sh.130 per litre to earn Sh.910,” said Michael.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there he has never looked back. Today, he buys up to about 30kgs a day of the fatty parts which gives him around 26 litres of pork lard after extraction which he does by heating the parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a day, he can sell up to 20 litres of the oil to wholesale buyers raking him Sh.2,600 while if he sells to retailers he makes Sh.3,000 selling at Sh.150 a litre.\n",
    "\n",
    "His main buyers are fish frying business people along Jogoo Road, in Burma Market while some in Gikomba Market. Others include samosa and bajia frying businesses along the busy Eastlands road.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I did not know that this business will peak this fast because as it is, it is now outdoing pork meat selling and I believe that as long as cooking oil prices will continue to stay up, more customers will come,” said Michael.\n",
    "\n",
    "He says many customers are now not only buying pork lard because of the high prices of cooking oil but also due to its nutritious value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experts assert that oil is one of the best sources of vitamin D, a nutrient most people are deficient in today. \n",
    "\n",
    "Research conducted in 2011 by Weston A. Price Foundation, a global nutrition and health platform found that lard from pasture-raised pigs contains 1100 IU of vitamin D per tablespoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lard is a good source of fats that support a healthy heart. In fact, after olive oil, which consists of 77 per cent monounsaturated fatty acids, lard has the most monounsaturated fats at 48 per cent.\n",
    "\n",
    "These fats help to lower blood cholesterol levels and maintain healthy cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, unlike most vegetable oils, which shouldn’t be used for high-heat cooking, lard won’t oxidize at high temperatures hence it has a high smoke point.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, food cooked using lard have an amazing taste hence generally enhancing the flavour of roasted vegetables, grilled meats, and even baked goods.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every day, week, month and year, Kenyans are partying. Company and religious entertainment events, weddings, birthdays and many other events are taking place everywhere all the time. Hiring out tents and chairs to these events is a good business idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is very simple, look out for those having these events and rent chairs and tents to them at a fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Equipment*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main requirements for this business will be tents and chairs. You are free to select various designs and capacities. These will be your main tools of trade in your business apart from dressings for the chairs, which you may choose to start with or make later, depending on your budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tents and chairs are widely available locally therefore you can start your tents and chairs hire business immediately. The price of the tents will depend on the type and how many people it can hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the shape and type, tents also come in different colours. In Nairobi, tents are easily available from roadside manufacturers. One of the best locations to find them is along Jogoo Road from City Stadium towards Buru Buru, on both sides of the road all the way to Outer Ring Road. Others can be found in Kariobangi. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will find all designs, colours, shapes and variety of materials used. To save on cost, it may be a good idea to visit these juakali manufacturers since their tents will be cheaper and there is always room for negotiation on the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good tent which can comfortably fit about 100 people may cost you anything between Sh.80,000 and Sh.100,000. This size of tent is enough to start you off in this business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, in any business start-up, saving on cost is very important therefore any chance that you get, ensure you take advantage of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chairs to use for your tent and chairs rental business are the ordinary plastic party chairs. Unlike tents, these chairs are widely available in many shops, including supermarkets. However, you will get very good bargains in areas around down town Nairobi, Kamukunji and Gikomba where they are sold in wholesale. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also buy directly from manufacturers in industrial area if you are buying in bulk. The chairs come in different colours therefore, choose the colour that best fits in with your tents. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many manufacturers all based around Lunga Lunga Road in Nairobi Industrial Area. Each plastic chair will cost you between Sh.450 and Sh.700.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Others*\n",
    "\n",
    "On some occasions, you may need some tables to go with the chairs and tents. If you have to, just go for one or two tables for a start. You may decide to add others later or as demand rises. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dressings for the chairs will depend on the occasion. You can go for a\n",
    "gazebo in addition to the tent, if your budget allows, or you can still go for them later or as demanded by your clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "*License*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good idea to apply for a license from the county government to operate your tent and chairs rental business to avoid run-ins with the authorities. This will cost you between Sh.3,000 and Sh.10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Transport*\n",
    "\n",
    "Tents and chairs are bulky items to handle and transport around. You should therefore think of transport arrangements as you plan to set up your tent and chairs rental business. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is not necessary to have your own means of transport since this will be much more expensive than even setting up the business itself. All you need will be a reliable, affordable and easily available means of transport such as a pick-up truck. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can talk to a transport provider near you and agree on terms of engagement. When you get an event, you can call the transporter and make prior arrangements for transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "Where you are located will influence your operations since you will have to transport your equipment to your clients. If you are located far off, transportation costs may consume much of your funds, thereby affecting your profitability. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have enough space, you can start by keeping your tents and chairs at home to cut on costs as you start the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is advisable to get a convenient place to store your items. If you rent out a space to keep your items, go for the smallest space you can find that will fit everything safely and securely, for a start.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Competition*\n",
    "\n",
    "In tents and chairs rental business, competition is stiff and therefore be ready to compete. Many people have been attracted to this business making it crowded but still profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some players in this business have now innovated and offer extra complimentary services such as public address systems, music entertainment systems, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let competition not scare you very much. Just ensure that you set your business with minimal costs at the start and network well. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you start the business, you can gradually upgrade and offer these added services later on in order to be more competitive too.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Marketing*\n",
    "\n",
    "As I have always said, setting up your business may be straight forward but remember, for you to make any money, your potential customers need to know that you are in business and can offer a solution to their problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t just open up and expect people to start jamming your lines with calls asking to rent your tents and chairs. You may wait forever. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a minimum, let them know that you exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a start, talk to family, friends and relatives and let them know you have bought tents and chairs and they are for hire at a fee. Other good places to market your business will be in religious and educational institutions. Visit these institutions during meetings and talk about your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Post notices on notice boards around shopping centres and market places. \n",
    "\n",
    "Word of mouth marketing too will be your great friend in this business.\n",

    "Social media such as posts on facebook pages and groups can also spread awareness and market your business. You can also advertise your business on free classified websites like jiji.co.ke.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Revenue*\n",
    "\n",
    "As you would expect, your tents and chairs rental business may take some time before good income starts flowing in. You should plan well and manage to continue operating even as you start before being profitable. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be mostly busy over the weekends and other holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect an income of about Sh.3,000 – Sh.5,000 when you hire out your tent in a day depending on size of tent, and another Sh.15 – Sh.20 for each chair. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you dress the chairs well, and get a table or two, you will have a chance to earn more. It is therefore clear that your income will depend on the size of your tent and the number of chairs and other equipment you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages of this business*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Needs few items therefore very easy to start.\n",

    "\n",
    "Just like many other things in the business world, product pricing has strategies which have to be mastered.\n",
    "\n",
    "How you price your product/service can be the difference between a profitable business and failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various pricing strategies known by the business genius. These strategies are tested and you can trust them to help you in your product/service pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I share that with you, let me tell you these three truths:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Your customers don`t know how much your product/service is worth*\n",
    "\n",
    "As a matter of fact, human beings don`t have a value meter on their heads. Don`t assume that people know how much they should buy things, they don`t.\n",
    "\n",
    "What actually happens is that, we usually make comparison between two things before we decide one is right or the other is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give you an example here.\n",
    "\n",
    "If today a telecom company wants to sell a sim card for Ksh.1,000 in Kenya, it will be obvious to everyone that such price is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is that price wrong? Yes, it`s wrong, but it was right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember Celtel in 2001 sold sim cards for Ksh.1,000 and people were joyfully rushing to buy them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are getting something.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don`t actually know how much we should buy things. The reason why we can decide that a thousand shillings for a sim card is too expensive is because we have other low prices to compare it with.\n",
    "\n",
    "That leads us to the second point.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Your position in the market determines the price of your product/service.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Why was Celtel able to “dupe” us by selling ordinary sim cards for as high as Ksh.1,000 in the past?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they were the leading telecom company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a leader in a market gives you an advantage to price your product higher than you can otherwise do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming to compete with the market leader, Safaricom had to fight with price. If you are going into a saturated market, you may have to fight with price.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you see, when you have nothing to fight with but price, you have already lost the battle.\n",
    "\n",
    "That`s why I will share the next point with you…\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. You can still charge good price, even if you are not the market leader, if you have a good position in your market.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a “me-too” person running “we too” company, your only weapon to make sales is low price and when it comes to that, you may get to a point when the margin between your cost of production and profit is not sufficient to pay your staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "That`s not business. That`s slavery.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you can be competing with other businesses in your market and still charge a moderate price?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you can do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can concentrate on values. You can compete with the value of your product/service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do I mean a better product/service here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, but even more… a unique position in your market place.\n",
    "\n",
    "By this I mean that you must differentiate yourself from your competitors. You must position yourself as being the leader in a particular segment, or an expert in something (which other competitors are not).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do this successfully, you can charge good price for your products or services… conveniently.\n",
    "\n",
    "After discussing these three basic truths with you, let`s now go into the proven pricing tactics you can use to sell more of your products or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Use Anchoring*\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchoring as a pricing strategy comes to live as a result of the psychological discovery about how human brains work.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you come across something big (let`s say an elephant) first and immediately see a smaller object (now a goat), that goat will look smaller than it is in the real sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to buy something you don`t have the idea of its price and the seller asks you to pay Ksh.1,000 and just after negotiation he agrees that you should pay Ksh.400, you are more likely to feel like you have gotten a good bargain than if the first price the seller offers is Ksh.500, isn`t it?\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you use anchoring in your pricing?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are selling varieties of items, make sure you place the higher price items before the lower price ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you`re selling a suit for Ksh.5,000, the best way to sell it fast is to place it right after a suit of Ksh.7,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens is, when people first come across a suit of Ksh.7,000 and then sees another for Ksh.5,000 that second price looks ridiculously cheaper than it would have been if there was never an anchor (the first, higher price)\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Nine is still powerful*\n",
    "\n",
    "Price ending in 9 is powerful, even till now. I know you must have been seeing prices of different items which end in 9. It was no mistake. It was a deliberate tactic of the smart marketers and business owners to price their goods and services for Ksh.499, Ksh.999 etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of pricing your product for Ksh.500, why not Ksh.499?\n",
    "\n",
    "Price ending with 9 will sell more of your products than price ending with even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Write it small*\n",
    "\n",
    "In human mind FIVE HUNDRED SHILLINGS is more than “five hundred shillings”.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your price is written big, your customers will (unconsciously) see it as expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Give two pricing options*\n",
    "\n",
    "As I have said earlier, we humans really don`t know what good price is. For us to know we are buying at good price, we must compare two prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "That`s the reason why some of us love to visit more than one sellers before we buy a particular item… we want to compare their prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can help your customers to compare prices easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you do this? Give two prices for your product/service whenever it`s applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can offer your service and offer the premium of the same service (with additional value). If the price of what you are selling is Ksh.2,000, premium version of it could be Ksh.5,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you may not sell much of the premium, more people will buy the normal version. Why? Because it`s now easy to compare between two prices and see that one is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of how a monthly magazine (or any other business) that requires customer's` subscription can do this;\n",
    "\n",
    "Paper version of the magazine`s publication = Ksh.2,500/annum\n",
    "\n",
    "Paper version + online version = Ksh.4,000/annum\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it`s now obvious that one price is better than another, it`s easier for your customers to compare the prices and go for the “cheaper” one (which is not actually cheap, but become so after comparison)\n",
    "\n",
    "If applicable, create a premium version of your product/service. You may not sell more of that premium version, but you will sell more of your ordinary version.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Don`t price everything the same*\n",
    "\n",
    "Human mind gets confused easily. If you are having a boutique and most of your clothes go for the same price, your customers will not be able to compare prices… which is very important for them to know which is better than what.\n",
    "\n",
    "They won`t just know which one to buy and they may just decide not to buy anyone. This is likely to happen because, to a large extent, most of us judge quality by price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell me you sell a pair of shoes for Ksh.2,500 and I will assume it`s good shoes, so by the time all your products go for the same price, people tend to be confused as per which is better than which.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let`s talk about something similar to this…\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Don`t sell good things too cheap*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have read about the experience of some people who increased the prices of their products, and unbelievably, the demand increased as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my personal experience, I have sold a digital product and received great testimonies from 90% of people who bought it, but when I give it out for free, maybe 1% of people even like it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? We have been programmed to judge things by their prices. “If it`s costly, it must be good”. That`s how we think.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can this affect you as a business owner? If you have a great product and decide to sell it at a cheap price, people may assume it`s a poor product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have a task of deciding between a moderate and cheap prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Present it in bits*\n",
    "\n",
    "I was on a website few days ago. The author is selling a one month course for $29. Instead of him to write, “Buy this course for $29”, he writes, “for less than a dollar per day, you can get this course…..”\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps people to see his product as “just a dollar per day” and not “$29”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you present your offer in bits?\n",
    "\n",
    "If people have to pay for your service for a whole year, you can reframe that price, help them to convert it to monthly payment and then present it as, “a year service for ksh.10,000. That`s just Ksh.830 per month”\n",
    "\n",
    "It`s easier to think of Ksh.830 per month than Ksh.10,000 per annum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ksh.830 per month is “cheaper” to the brain than Ksh.10,000 per annum, isn`t it? Yet, they are both the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "*8. Add “just” or “only”*\n",
    "\n",
    "The word “just” “only” “a token” and other words that sound small make people to assume it`s actually small.\n",
    "\n",
    "You wonder why it`s that way? We humans are not rational. We are irrational. We don`t know as much as we usually want to think we do.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have seen it in places. Marketers use the word “only Ksh.50” or “just Ksh.900” etc. to sell their products or services and it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add “only” “just” etc. before your prices and sell more of whatever you`re selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "*9. PWYW*\n",
    "\n",
    "That`s “pay what you want”. If you are selling digital things like music, eBooks etc., you can try this. Ask people to pay whatever they want, then suggest a minimum price.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens here is that, you have removed the first resistance of “I can`t afford it”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay What You Want sounds so good that everybody will be open to your offer (after all, I can pay whatever I want to get this, isn`t that?)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you intend to sell such product for Ksh.300, you can then suggest that buyers pay Ksh.300, Ksh.500 and above. Then add, “Just anything you can afford”.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens here is that you have suggested the lowest price you want (and trust me, most people will not go below that). Some people will pay above your actual price, some will pay exact amount but the joy of it all is that… you will sell more of your products.\n",
    "\n",
    "*10. Beware of comma*\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at these two prices: 6,000 and 6000. Which of them looks more expensive?\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at these too; 5,000.00, 5,000 and 5000.\n",
    "\n",
    "You get my message. If your price has the comma and that dot, it looks expensive than if the two are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "“But that`s not a correct way my math teacher taught me”!\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, your math teacher taught you mathematics. I am teaching business.\n",

    "\n",
    "Whether you love or hate matatus one thing is clear, the kind of work they do is simply phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "From dealing with moody and sometimes downright unfriendly customers to surviving in an insanely competitive industry, being a ‘makanga’ requires nerves of steel and ability to do what’s beyond the obvious to survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules are not too different in the world of entrepreneurship either.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to survive against all odds and put your best foot forward in order to guarantee your existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have lifted a few practical lessons from the dusty streets of Nairobi and here are some tactics you can take out from your matatu crews playbook on the fundamentals of running a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1) Yell About Your Product At The Top Of Your Voice*\n",
    "\n",
    "You are in business to sell; not to sit down and look pretty. And our matatu guys seem to know this quite well. They shout at the top of their voices “Namba nane, Kibera” “Namba nane, Kibera” without tiring.\n",
    "\n",
    "They know that if they keep quiet some other matatu will get ahead of them and make the money. Likewise in business, you have to shout a little louder about the problems your product or idea can help solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it not your habit as a commuter to always turn your head to the matatu that constantly mentions your route? That is the same case in business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The businessman who constantly reaches out to new markets is the one who naturally ranks on top of the customer’s mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2) Be quick to get in sync with your market needs*\n",
    "\n",
    "A route 44 matatu will get to the stage at Roysambu and find a whole crowd of people. The tout gets busy shouting “Githurai mbao” but alas! No one wants to board.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does he do? He gets one of those shouting makangas at the stage to find out where most of the people want to go. The next thing you see, a stampede as people rush to get a seat in that matatu simply because the tout announced that he is going to “Kahawa” and not “Githurai” as he had shouted earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of business, you’ll find that sometimes you need to get in sync with the needs of your target market in pretty much the same way our touts do. Find out what drives your customer’s passion, what needs do they want met and how they want you to solve their problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with this kind of information, go ahead and shout at the top of your lungs and then sit down and watch the stampede!\n",
    "\n",
    "*3)Teamwork is the recipe for success*\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever observed how the driver and his tout collaborate? When the tout bangs the side of the matatu, the driver immediately knows it is time to GO, and he does not question it. He goes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Equally, when the driver sees a potential customer he quickly steps on the brake and the tout automatically knows it’s time to make some more money and so he woos the person in.\n",
    "\n",
    "During rush hour when the traffic situation gets out of hand, the tout does not sit cosy in his chair, he quickly exits and rushes ahead to scout the territory for a way out. He will not come back until he has a suggestion for the driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of teamwork is indeed an enviable trait that we need to embrace even in our businesses. Be a team player. Let your team (if you have employees that is) learn to work seamlessly independently and simultaneously interdependently.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, you will be able to bolster your productivity and enhance a sense of collective responsibility at the workplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4) Create a sense of scarcity to drive more sales*\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bus stop, the touts know that most passengers will choose the matatu that is partially filled over a completely empty one. So they pay a few guys to fill up the seats for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voila! It works like magic and within a few minutes the once empty van leaves the bus stage full of paying customers. Have you ever fallen prey to this weird tactic? I have been a victim quite a few times too.\n",
    "\n",
    "But instead of getting angry I can’t help but admire the level of marketing ingenuity employed by these mostly unlearned fellows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, in business, sometimes you have to create a sense of scarcity and urgency in order to drive the sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only that you need to do it with a measure of ingenuity just like our beloved makangas do.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5) If you don’t have quality networks you are as good as dead*\n",
    "\n",
    "All matatu crews irrespective of the routes they ply work like a team. They stay in touch and look out for each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the traffic police or NTSA guys are down the road, one driver will signal this information to others going in that direction. If there is traffic along Waiyaki Way, the tout will get this information from another who is on location and be advised to use Lower Kabete road instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such camaraderie is invaluable in business. Whether it is for sharing new ideas and experiences or for referrals and outsourcing options, no one can prosper in business by thinking and acting in solitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "So invest in quality networks always.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6) When the market runs dry, push the limits*\n",
    "\n",
    "Matatus, just like most businesses, have peak and off peak hours. During off peak hours, the crew will drive right through an estate and even reverse the vehicle so at to pick a customer right from his gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new prospective customer is spotted, the tout will beckon, woo and coax them and then proceed to open the door for them – and this tactic actually works 98% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such is the life of an entrepreneur. Sometimes, you have to get out of your way to keep your business moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if it means working overnight or treating customers like royalty, when it comes to keeping your business breathing you better be prepared to push the limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7) There is always a way out of every situation*\n",
    "\n",
    "Somehow, your matatu driver will always find a way forward. He will pass via some unusual routes or even break the law and overlap. Sometimes he will even cut corners and do a detour just so that he can keep moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "His attitude is: there is always a way. He is conditioned thus; and therein lies a very important lesson for entrepreneurs – persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not unethical persistence like in the case of most matatu driver, but a strong determination to go against all odds to overcome rejection and to maintain a steady pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "And when everybody else is stuck in the traffic of “I don’t have capital” or “The market is saturated”, you know there is always a way to keep pressing forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "So condemn the matatu driver for overlapping but silently grab this precious lesson of believing there is a way forward even when everyone else is stuck in conformity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "Being in the world of matatu is twice as difficult as operating in most other businesses. It is often said that if you are able to apply 50% of the efforts of the matatu crew, you can significantly maximize productivity, enhance teamwork and most importantly improve your sales.\n",

    "\n",
    "When it comes to saving and investing, many people are torn between SACCOs and Money Market Funds. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why people save or invest. Your investment goal can help you decide what to pick, SACCO or Money Market Fund. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose to invest your money through a SACCO or a Money Market Fund. So, what is the difference between a SACCO and a Money Market Fund?\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is a SACCO?*\n",
    "\n",
    "SACCO stands for Savings and Credit Cooperative. It is a group of people with a similar goal or interest who come together to form a credit union. These people pull funds together by mobilizing savings so that they can access loans at low-interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In SACCOs, members contribute some amount of money every month that helps them build up their shares. The SACCO then invests this money by giving out loans to the same members at an interest rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the interest rates the SACCO gets from the issuance of loans, it distributes the gains to the members as dividends. The rate of dividends is declared by the Directors at the end of the financial year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is a Money Market Fund?*\n",
    "\n",
    "A Money Market Fund is a mutual fund or unit trust that invests in highly liquid instruments like cash, securities, and cash equivalents. These securities usually have a short maturity term which can be around 12 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, a Money Market Fund is a kind of unit trust where people pull funds together to invest in a collective scheme. Their money can be invested in treasury bonds or shares.\n",
    " \n",
    "Investors’ money in the Money Market Fund is managed by financial experts known as Money Market Fund managers. You will notice that most Money Market Funds are operated by insurance firms, meaning your investment is secure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Money Market Funds’ interests are calculated daily, from Monday to Friday, and deposited into the account at the end of the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Which is Better: Sacco or Money Market Fund?*\n",
    "\n",
    "It really depends on your goal. If you are looking for a long term investment option and access to cheaper loans, go for a SACCO. If you are looking for a short term investment option with high liquidity, go for a Money Market Fund. \n",
    "\n",
    "*How a SACCO Works*\n",
    "\n",
    "With a SACCO, you need to be making monthly contributions to help you grow your shares. From the monthly contributions you make, the SACCO gives loans to members at interest rates. From the interest rates the SACCO gets from the issuance of loans, it distributes the gains to members based on their shares as dividends. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most SACCOs give loans of up to three times the members’ shares. So, if you have shares worth Ksh.30,000, you can get a loan of up to Ksh.90,000. Loans from SACCOs attract low interest rates compared to those from banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To become a member, you need to register with a SACCO and make monthly contributions for at least 3 months. For most SACCOs, minimum monthly contribution is usually Ksh.2,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dividend rates are usually between 8% and 20%, depending on the SACCO. If you want to withdraw your shares from a SACCO, you need to wait for at least 2 months. Alternatively, you can transfer your shares to someone else.\n",
    " \n",
    "*How a Money Market Fund Works*\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if your goal is to save some money and get an extra coin after some time, go for a Money Market Fund. Most MMFs pay an interest rate of between 5% and 11%. Interest rates are calculated daily, Monday to Friday, and deposited into your account at the end of the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a Money Market Fund, the MMF manager manages the investor’s money. If you want to get back your money, you just need to write to the MMF manager and you will have your cash in just 3 working days.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conclusion: SACCO vs Money Market Fund?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, SACCOs and Money Market Funds are equally good. It all depends on your goal. If you are looking for a short term investment and earn get some revenues, go for an MMF. If you are looking for an investment option to grow your portfolio over time and get loans at low rates, go for a SACCO.\n",

    "You were born poor, but if you die poor you have yourself to blame. Before you finish reading this article, at least 8 out of 10 people will have done something that contributes to their future poverty. Only 2 out of 10 will have done what is required to remain prosperous in the future. \n",

    "\n",
    "*1. You focus on linear income instead of passive income*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people focus on linear income in the name of salary, allowances and one-off payments. Wise men on the other hand focus on passive income in the name of royalties, interest rates, value addition and profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relying on linear income is similar to using buckets to fetch water from the river. With time, you’ll get too old and too tired to transport them to and fro and that means you’ll have to starve for as long as you don’t go to the river.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relying on passive income on the other hand is similar to building a pipeline. It may require a lot of work at the beginning but with time, you’ll no longer have to go to the river to get water – the river will come to you and you’ll not starve.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most fundamental principal of wealth creation that most (including you) are oblivious about.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. You’re still waiting to start your journey of success*\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone wants to succeed but very few people are willing to step into the cold waters. In the history of the world, no marathon race has ever been won (or even finished) by someone who never left the starting line.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you’re stuck saying that you have no enough capital to start, someone else is busy making good use of whatever little they have.\n",

    "\n",
    "Continue waiting at the starting line and poverty will soon find you there to keep you company.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. When you earn more you spend more*\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistently raising your expenditure is a good way to accumulate debt and to remain stuck in the echelons of poverty. To stay out of bad debt, you will either need to find a way to earn more or spend less. The first and best option is to find ways to earn more and keep your expenditure constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know this can only be done by creating multiple streams of income and lot’s of thinking is necessary in that case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second option is to simply cut on unnecessary expenses. The money that is saved from these budget cuts could be used for embarking on future investment programs.\n",

    "\n",
    "An example of a long-term perspective is when a wise family man buys land or insurance for their child, even though he or she will not need it for the next eighteen years. This is a long-term approach that involves sacrificing in the short term to assure better outcomes in the long-term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people remain poor because their “time perspective” is focused on short-term goals such as meeting basic lifestyle needs, buying luxury items, paying rent etc…are you one of them?\n",

    " \n",
    "Kitchen is one critical area in any home because that’s where health of the family is defined through the meals. Without a kitchen, humanity could be extinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kitchen utensils and equipment business is not business you can avoid and sleep peacefully, it’s lucrative. One beautiful thing about the business is that it’s not saturated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kitchen equipment include plates, spoons, cups, mugs, jugs, fridges, oven, microwave, thermos, gas, forks etc. They are all important in the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that you have the idea in mind but you are not in a position to execute it, the following is the easiest way to start the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to start the business*\n",
    "\n",
    "First, identify ideal location with busy streets and people with ability to buy your products. You cannot take your business in a village where there are 10 people and expect to get profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to run the business. To start with, you have to buy a vehicle which you would be using to transport the utensils to the village and move them within the villages. The method works because you will identify the day when it’s market day and then take the items to the market for sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also stock them in a shop/stall for customers to visit and pick their favorites.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Capital required for the business*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you intend to start small, Ksh.150,000 is enough in small towns like Narok, Kericho, Voi, Kakamega and Machakos but if you intend to set up in towns like Nairobi, Kisii, Nakuru and Mombasa, you need at least Ksh.300,000.This is because of the rental cost and operating expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you intend to sell in large scale, capital of at least Ksh 1 million is required. You also require a vehicle if your business will be mobile.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are individuals who would want to hawk utensils around town or from house to house, this one is cheap to start because with just Ksh.20,000, you are ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Profits*\n",
    "\n",
    "The business is very profitable, especially if you set up in a busy town. If you started with Ksh.150,000, your monthly profit must be at least Ksh.50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Best towns to start the business*\n",
    "\n",
    "The best towns for this business are Kisumu, Mombasa, Kisii, Busia, Nairobi and Nakuru. These towns are ideal because of the large population which lives there.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Legal requirement*\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing that’s required is a license, which is obtained from the local county council. The cost of the license ranges from Ksh.5,000 to Ksh.15,000 per year depending on the size of your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How I make money from selling household items*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every payday, Jacinta Mutoro would make allocations to her expenses as many employees do. The result for the lab technician was always the same – what she earned (Sh.24,000 per month) was far from enough to cater for her needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In May 2015, with Sh.3,000 in capital, she decided to start a small business to supplement her income. She has not regretted her decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "6 years down the line since she started her business, In a good month, she now makes about Sh.800,000 from selling household items. She started by buying her goods from Eastleigh, Nairobi as ordered by her clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "“My colleagues loved my products so much. I used to sell them the goods on credit. They would pay me after two months or so. In the process, I identified my market niche,” said Ms Jacinta.\n",
    "\n",
    "She noticed there was a big demand for handbags and mosquito nets, which she sourced from wholesalers in Mombasa. Every week, she said, she would sell around four handbags from which she made significant profit. She saved the money, intent on using it to start importing goods from abroad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Jacy’s Smart Collection deals with all households wares from inflatable beds, pull out sofa beds, carpets, utensils to handbags, plastic wardrobes and home decorations. She sources them from Turkey, China and the wider European market.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I linked with one of the suppliers in China and started importing goods. Back then majority of the items were handbags, but now I sell all types of household goods. I import all of them. A client just has to say what they need and I will get it,” she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experience has made her understand the market well and she is today able to the meet needs of customers with different tastes.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sometimes other businesses get similar products, hence I have to be very keen on trends. Each time I have to bring in something new to meet the client’s needs,” she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Besides meeting my basic needs and other expenses such as rent, the business has helped me support my family back at home. I have also employed my siblings,” she added.\n",
    "\n",
    "She has also employed seven people who assist her in running the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of her products, which she either sells wholesale or retail, go for between Sh.2,000 and Sh.14,000. And in order to reach out to customers, she uses social media platforms such as Facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://web.facebook.com/jacysmartcollection  \n",
    "\n",
    "Word of mouth, however, has been the greatest driver behind her growing client base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over and above the two branches she operates in Mombasa and Nairobi, she also supplies the products to other towns through courier deliveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "She says balancing between her full-time job and the venture needs can be taxing, but the returns make it all worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Both of these jobs are important to me, so I am forced to work very hard. I am a very busy person, but my family has really supported me. My brother assists in the management of the business,” she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business is not without its challenges. The biggest of them is the fluctuations in freight charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Freight importation charges sometimes change. For instance you had expected to be charged Sh.35,000, but on arrival of your goods the charges increase. It was a big challenge especially during the electioneering period,” she said.\n",

    "She hopes to expand the business to other regions in the country. For her side-hustling is not only a way to make ends meet, but also about pursuing a passion and fulfilling customer’s needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "She encourages prospective entrepreneurs to start a venture with whatever amount of capital they have.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Start with whatever you have. Be it Sh.1,000 or Sh.2,000. You may never get a lump sum for you to start. However little you start with, it will one day grow big” she said.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, most people who think about starting a business usually don't consider writing a business plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have read from different business experts about the fact that most start-up entrepreneurs do not write a business plan but what I have not read from anyone is why this is so. \n",

    "Why is it that most people have fear (so to say) about writing a business plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "I know the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, there are many myths and lies you probably have heard about the subject of a business plan. Some people present a business plan as if it was a university thesis or an academic report to be defended before certain professors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other people think that a business plan has to be 50 pages long and that it must be written in a certain “approved” format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I am here to tell you that all those opinions are not valid. \n",

    "\n",
    "Journey with me as I will reveal the real truth about business plan and at the end, you will discover that it is actually easy to write a business plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "*WHY DO YOU NEED A BUSINESS PLAN?*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three reasons why anyone may need a business plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, if you are about to start a business and you want to convince certain people to support your business financially. In this case, you will need to use your business plan to “sell” your business idea to the investors so that they will be willing to finance your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, if you want to start a business and you are willing to be successful. Though you don`t need external investors, you obviously need to grow, to compete and to win the battle of the market place, you need a business plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, you may need a new business plan because the economic or market situation has made your last plans obsolete. A Business plan is not like an academic paper which may stand for many years and still be relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote a business plan last year (I think April) and by December, it was already obsolete. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why? \n",
    "\n",
    "You really don`t know tomorrow. Your projections, plans or tactics are dependent on many factors that are beyond your power and when things change that affect your business (positively or negatively), then your plans also must be re-written.\n",
    "\n",
    "*HOW LONG SHOULD A BUSINESS PLAN BE?*\n",
    "\n",
    "It all depends on your objective and who will read it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last business plan I wrote was written on a single sheet of A4 paper. I typed and printed it out. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you intend to write a business plan for yourself and not to convince any investor, I strongly recommend that you write your business plan in a single sheet of paper or two, worst, three.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know this is a strange advice so let me explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, human nature loves complexity while simplicity is the only valuable thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anything that is too complex will give you stress and then become a burden on you, then you will abandon it ... making it useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are planning to write a business plan for your own usefulness, you will have to review it often (or else you won't even follow it), so tell me, which document is easier to review, a twenty pages document or two?\n",
    "\n",
    "You know the answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if you want to write a business plan to convince investors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people will advise you to write 50 pages and some other entrepreneurs might have written 100 pages in the past, but let me tell you the truth, nobody has time to read your thesis except the university professors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only people who have so much time are the poor people and I am sure if at all you want to use your business plan to get an investor to finance your business, then you are talking about someone who is (probably) very busy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me tell you this so that you will understand what I am saying here. Many CVs have been submitted to me by job seekers in the past and I am sure they would have prepared those CVs thinking, “I will impress the employers”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, here comes the sad news ... I have never in my life read a CV, I scan through them. I don`t have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your business plan is like the CV for the job seekers. How long should it be?\n",
    "\n",
    "Its again depends on who will read it. 10 pages may help you. 15 pages may help you, but when you are going beyond 20 pages, I am out! \n",
    "\n",
    "If you forget everything, make sure you don`t forget this... the investors you will give your business plan, really don`t have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*FOR HOW MANY YEARS SHOULD A BUSINESS PLAN BE?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Another area where people miss it. They are writing 5 or 10 years business plan. I laugh. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about planning for your business the way you think about goals for your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first learned about goal setting, I was impressed and I started by writing 5 to 10 years goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "It never worked. I later started writing one year goals and now I am writing goals for a third of the year (4 months). \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is simple... you are a human being like all of us. What you think/plan may not happen the way you plan it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any business plan that is more than one year is actually questionable. That is my opinion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any other business expert may tell you something different. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let me cross out a popular lie about a business plan. Most people believe that if your business plan is well written, it will win you huge amount of money from the investors. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is like telling a graduate, hey, if you can write your CV very well, you will be employed in a big company. \n",

    "\n",
    "Do you think your intending investors will be bought by a super-written plan? Think again.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You have to understand in and out, front and back, up and down of your intended business. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the written plan is nothing but the abstract of what is in your head, or else, you will fail in your attempt to convince business partners or investors to help finance your business.\n",

    "\n",
    "I advise you to conduct a market analysis. What that simply means is that you should spend time to research and understand your market, then position yourself with the tactics to win. That`s what an investor wants you to tell him here.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Competitors` analysis.*\n",
    "\n",

    "It simply means that you should analyze the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunity, Reward and the Threats in the market place.\n",

    "\n",
    "Africa is a hungry continent and you can never go wrong if you invest in food business. Everyone needs to eat and the escalating rate of rural to urban migration means more new mouths to feed every day. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is why the idea of starting a cereal shop is a good one. This is one of those businesses that you can start with as little as Ksh.20,000 and scale up to Ksh.1,000,000 in a year if you play your cards right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to know more? Read the next few paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When i talk about cereals i mean dry grains e.g. maize, beans, green grams, groundnuts etc. Not breakfast cereals like corn flakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Getting Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "First identify an ideal (preferably residential) location. This should be a place that is densely populated. Places like Githurai, Mwiki, Ruai, Kamulu, Thika Makongeni, Mtwapa e.t.c.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally open a shop in an area that is densely populated preferably with people of the lower and upper middle class income levels. A good room with enough foot-traffic in these areas can cost you anything from Ksh.5,000 per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Plan On What To Stock*\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t have to be a farmer to get your stock of cereals. There are many wholesalers who can supply you with your initial stock at a reasonable price (in Nairobi wholesalers are mainly found in Nyamakima area). \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively you can plan for a trip to the rural areas so that you can negotiate for even cheaper prices. For instance, you can get cheaper rice from places like Mwea and Kagio or cheaper maize from Chwele in Western Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tips For Buying Stock*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Make sure the grains are properly dried to prevent rotting as this could “burn” you.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Timing is important. For instance, it is cheaper to acquire your maize stock when farmers are looking to empty their granaries awaiting the next harvest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the fast moving products out of a cereal shop include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Beans: Nyayo, Rosecoco, Yellow beans, Mwitemania, Butter Beans, Gituru and Gachuma varieties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Porridge Flour: Baridi, Wimbi, Mawele, Mtama, Ndimu.\n",
    "\n",
    "Green Grams: Ordinary, Nylon, Makueni, Lentils.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nuts: Njugu Mawe, Groundnuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rice: Pure Mwea, Thailand, Pakistan, Sindano, Fivestar, Basmati, Brown Mwea.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now up to this point, you have identified a good location and identified the best places to buy your initial stock. What next?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Get Licensed*\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to go to your sub-county offices to get this. The officers there will give you some forms to fill and then they’ll come to visit your premises. Then depending on the size of your premises they will issue you with a single business permit charge. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some counties like Nairobi, you can book a 3 month, 6 month or 12 month license depending on how flexible you are financially.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4: Do Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that the first days of opening the shop will be dry days in terms of few customers. But instead of sitting in the cereal store and whining the whole day, the best thing would be to start by visiting institutions around you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make friends with the caterers, give them a good deal and they will gradually become your customers. Apply for tenders from local organizations also. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the day-to-day customers, sell to them on a cash-only basis – avoid selling on credit. From my research, credit sales are the main cause of failure for small cereal and whole grain outlets.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ksh.20,000 – Ksh.80,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns vary depending on where you buy your stock and how aggressively you resell it. On average you get 25% net profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also think of having a posho mill along side this business so that you can tap more profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing with starting a cereal shop is that unlike other ideas you can start this immediately. Typically, apart from securing a good location, quality stock and the county license there are no other major requirements for starting. \n",
    "\n",
    "And you don’t have to spend the whole day in the shop to ensure your workers conduct themselves appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in other words, you can either start this as a full-time business or as a side-hustle. You only need to invest in stock cards so that you can track how and when every kilo of cereal is bought from your shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The returns are however not as mouth-watering as you would expect especially if you are one of those who dream of getting rich overnight. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the kind of business where you start small and grow big especially as you build connections with institutions and hotels around your place.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every business exists to sell something and without sales, all businesses would certainly die. That’s why it’s always important to find out the real reasons why customers are not buying your products or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever you are selling, the whole idea of succeeding in business is to find customers who will gladly give you their money in exchange for that thing you are selling.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nobody buys stuff unless they are hungry for it, or want it just for fun. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom line: People usually buy stuff they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest mistake most business people make is to sell a product that customers don’t need.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I have a full tank of petrol in my car and you are trying to sell me another 30 litres, you will be wasting your time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why should I need extra petrol when I already have a full tank? Even if I could afford the petrol you are selling, I wouldn’t buy it because I don’t need it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at a practical example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fred lives in Nairobi in a neighbourhood with a large population of young working class people. Many of these people are single and work from 9 to 5 everyday. They come back home tired and spend their weekends catching up on lost sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fred comes up with a brilliant idea and starts a laundry business within the area. He offers to pick up dirty laundry from peoples’ homes and delivers them clean and fresh in under three days.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think happened? Business boomed! Why? His target customers had a desperate need for the convenience that his laundry service provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is often that many entrepreneurs do not target the right customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We often go ahead to create an amazing product or start up a business without first researching if the market has a need for what we are selling (or about to sell). \n",
    "\n",
    "You may sell a wonderful product or deliver an amazing and professional service but if people don’t need it, they won’t buy it, no matter how hard you try.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would customers not need the product or service you are selling? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Competition* – If there is a product or business that already provides a solution to your target customers’ needs and problems, they wouldn’t buy from you. Except if they are not satisfied with the product or service they currently use.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if your product is more valuable (cheaper, faster, better, safer etc) than the ones they already use, they would, at least, consider yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Substitutes* – If I have a domestic help at home who does a good job with my dirty laundry, why would I want to pay a laundry business to do the same job? If my car runs on diesel and you are trying to sell me petrol, why should I even listen to you?\n",
    "\n",
    "If your target customers already have a substitute product or service that already does the same thing as your product, they may likely not need yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson here is simple: Any product that doesn’t solve an urgent pain or a pressing problem will be a tough sell to customers anywhere. More than 90 percent of sales happen because a customer needs a product or service to solve their pains and problems.\n",

    "To start the venture in Kenya, requires at least Ksh.10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not a secret anymore that business of selling ladies handbags in Kenya is a booming venture. It becomes juicier when those engaged in full time employment engage in this business as a side hustle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best places to source for women handbags is Eastleigh Nairobi. And the best towns to start the business include Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and Nakuru.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have interacted with many women engaging in this business, either in part time or full time, and they have intimated to me that starting is hard but once you gain referrals and enough customer base, becoming rich will not be a theory but part of you. What you need to know is where to buy cheap and maximize profits by setting wide profit margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be on the safer side, ensure you have a good Facebook Page with at least 3,000 followers. You can promote your page or tell your friends to like it and share with their friends. Facebook and Instagram have become the largest single source of customers for handbag sellers in the country.\n",

    "The capital required for women handbag business vary depending on the location and where you intend to conduct the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have Ksh.15,000, you can comfortably start the business. However, you will be moving around selling to your friends since a physical location might be expensive. I encourage anyone to start the business from home and monitor its performance before deciding to operate from a stall.\n",
    "\n",
    "A careful selection of physical location is important. In order to operate from a stall be prepared to have at least Ksh.150,000 if you are in Nairobi and Ksh.100,000 if you will be operating in Mombasa, Nakuru, Kisii or Kisumu. This mount will cater for three months’ rent, a license and the cost of buying your first stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best place to buy women handbags is either Gikomba or Eastleigh, Nairobi. If you are outside Nairobi, please don’t allow those brokers in your town to make extra ordinary profits from you. What they normally do is to buy from Gikomba or Eastleigh and come to sell for you at exorbitant prices.\n",

    "While I was in campus, there was one meal I came to love; Pork. I never grew tired of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it isn’t so common where I come from. But mostly because each bite tasted like the choirs of umami-clad angels singing on my tongue.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I loved every bite.\n",
    "\n",
    "It wasn’t just me. It was everyone who lived around campus. The eateries would be packed and the butcheries would sell out.\n",
    "\n",
    "How so?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me first spoil you with some statistics about the pork business in Kenya before we continue with my story.\n",
    "\n",
    "The demand for pork in Kenya is very high. In 2012 alone, the pork produced in Kenya was approximately 12,950 tonnes, which meant there was a deficit in the quantity of produced pork countrywide.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pork industry has become even more popular since then but not to the point that demand has been met.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is therefore a need for more business people to venture into the pork industry in Kenya to bridge the gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re wondering whether to start a pork business, stop wondering. Simply start. If that seems like a too vague response, here’s how to start a pork business in Kenya with all the facts you need to know;\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. CHOOSE YOUR BUSINESS.*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several forms in which you may start your pork business, big or small. It’s all up to you. You could be creative and figure it out but the most common are;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pork Delivery Business:* – People do this using a bicycle or motorcycle. It is perhaps the most labor-intensive and needs a couple of operational logistics to work. However, it does not cost too much to start. For one, you do not need a premise because what you do is deliver pork to people, cooked or raw, in small quantities and packaged wherever they need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Butcheries:* Like most butcheries, a pork butchery sells raw pork by the gram, chopped or whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hotels:* Pork hotels could have many different types of food but the main thing is that the cuisine is pork. Whether fried pork, barbecued pork, glazed pork, bacon, ham, sausage or other pork dishes, the common ingredient is pork.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Butchery and eatery:* Most people go for this option because it gives a variety of options to you. You can meet the market’s demands for raw pork and cooked pork at the same time. Operations are also easier in terms of acquiring meat and picking the parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Barbecue joints:* They are joints that serve barbecued pork. It is another easy way to start because the cuisine is mainstream; barbecue.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Outside catering:* With outside catering, you provide pork cooking services to clients at a fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. GET A LICENSE.*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various licenses required to run a pork business. These are the very basic licenses that you ought to get to start your business;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Single-User Business permit:* It is usually issued by the county to all businesses. It varies between businesses from Ksh.5,000 to Ksh.20,000 depending on the county.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Public Health Licenses:* This is needed for all premises dealing with food. The Kenyan system is not as strict when giving health licenses and they generally cost Ksh.3000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Medical Health certificate:* All your workers need to have medical health certificates which typically cost about Ksh.1,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fire inspection license:* It’s always safe to have a fire extinguisher wherever cooking is involved. For this inspection and license, costs vary from county to county, the average being Ksh.2,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Outdoor advertising license:* Costs for this usually vary depending on the type you want and size. Of course, you do not necessarily need this and could opt for the other means of advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. CHOOSE THE LOCATION FOR YOUR BUTCHERY.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing your location is very important even if your business is mobile.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several factors you need to take into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility: You should look at how easy it is to get to your premises by foot and car. Look at things like road conditions, parking, visibility, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foot traffic: Place your premises where there are a lot of people walking on foot rather than highways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilities: It is important to be in a place that is accessible to important utilities such as electricity and water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographics: Find areas that are populated so that you have more consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Style of operation: The area around your premises should reflect your style, whether fancy, elegant or young.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competition: Observe the competition around you. Similar businesses around you may make your business a bit difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "When setting up your pork business, it’s not only the location that you need to look for but also the arrangement of spaces within your premises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be smart when picking out where your kitchen will be, entrance, eating area and style of the premises.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, the kitchen is usually better being the furthest and the entrance being the most visible area. I have seen eateries with the kitchen being right at the front and it seemed to work for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, the sky’s the limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. IDENTIFY PORK SUPPLIERS FOR YOUR BUSINESS.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people may want their pork business to start from pork farming which is another area altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you want to simply buy pork, you could go to your cattle slaughterhouses, pig slaughterhouses, farmers, and brokers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to buy meat that is inspected for legal purposes and health’s sake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some major pig slaughterhouses to help you out are;\n",
    "\n",

    "Ndumboini slaughterhouse - Ndumboini, near Waiyaki way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utudi - Nakuru.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other many more slaughterhouses in various parts of the country that I can`t list them all here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Find out the nearest slaughterhouse to where you want to set up your pork business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. GET SETUP AND EQUIPMENT.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of setting up, you need equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of equipment you may need is;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Weighing machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Furniture: Seats and tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cooking apparatus.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Customer cutlery and crockery.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tap and sink.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Freezer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of other things you may need depending on the business, for example for delivery, you may need packaging and a means of transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a butchery, you may need a grinder. It all depends on the type of pork business you want to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. HOW TO RUN A PROFITABLE PORK BUSINESS IN KENYA.*\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The various operations involved in a pork business are;\n",
    "\n",
    "Buying good pork: You need to know where to buy pork, what type of pork and cuts you need, the quantity of pork and delivery of the pork to your premises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing pork quantities: This should all depend on the scale of your business and how many consumers will be coming in to avoid wastage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparing the pork for serving: preparation involves cleaning, preservation and weighing for the consumers to carry or eat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooking the pork: This depends on the type of business and cuisine. For a butchery, you serve it raw and for an eatery, you have to cook it with accompanying dishes too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Serving customers: This requires professionalism, speed, warmth, and efficiency among the servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Receiving payment and accounting: This needs to be done efficiently, by trustworthy people to avoid making a loss.\n",

    "\n",
    "They say you cannot start by becoming great but you can become great by starting. This is a mindset that has indeed built great business entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take, for instance, the business of supplying fast-moving goods such as cakes, mandazis, soft drinks, and bread among others from manufacturers which requires small capital to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, a product’s route to the market is one of the crucial factors every manufacturer considers in their quest to make sales by moving their goods closer to consumers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where you come in as a distributor by either becoming a subcontracted distributor by the appointed agents or doing it solo by buying as a wholesaler.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both approaches, you do not need to own a company under which you operate but a capital of Sh.50,000 which you can easily get if you have been doing some savings with a Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations (SACCO) or otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of being a member of a SACCO is the ease of accessing loans as they give up to five times the amount saved allowing you a very good capital base for the business and low interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this money, you need to, first of all, identify some of the small shops or resellers and which products they sell as they would be your main target markets before setting up or renting a store where they will easily locate you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Nairobi’s central business district (CBD), for example, you can actually get a rental store of 50 meters square at as low as Sh.1,500 a month or Sh.200 per square feet of rental space.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then need some means of transport to move your goods around and because you want to start small, avoid a pick-up or a car, hire a tuk-tuk (three-wheeled vehicle) or motorcycle which can be charged Sh.1,000 per day depending on the load weight given they are meant for short distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load weight equivalent to that of three passengers is charged Sh.50 depending on the distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this is done, you can then approach the manufacturer producing the products that you want to trade in or their agents and buy the goods wholesale for distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baked mandazis like the famously known KDFs are always packed 60 per packet. This is the same as the small cakes which are always sold at Sh.10 to Ksh.20 in small shops.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can acquire these from bakers at Sh.45 per packet then distribute to resellers at Sh.50 earning Sh.5 a packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you can carry not less than 200 such packets in crates on your motorcycle at a go, you will make Sh.1,000 gross profit and Sh.2,000 in a day if you have two trips in the morning and evening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, a piece of bread in wholesale will cost you Sh.43. You can then distribute it to the small shops at Sh.48 getting Sh.5 per bread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a crate carries about 10 pieces of bread translating to Sh.50 per create and assuming you can distribute up to 100 crates a day (on the lower side), you will be carrying home Sh.5,000 gross income a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you grow and you want to get more formal, it is good to note that of the various distribution channels, manufacturers often appoint a third-party distributor to undertake this function by entering into what is known as distribution agreements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A distribution agreement sets out the contractual relationship between a manufacturer and a distributor detailing the terms under which the distributor may sell the manufacturer’s products in a given market.\n",

    "Do not trade blindly or else you will get yourself on the wrong side of the law. Like any other business, the distribution of products is also protected by law.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Competition Act, No.12 of 2010 (the Act) restrictive or anti-competitive trade practices which may affect trade within Kenya is prohibited.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this action under Kenyan law, distribution agreements are deemed to be vertical arrangements within the production or distribution chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, they are capable of involving negative trade practices that impact competition. Such practices in distributorship include the unreasonable increase in the cost of production or distribution of commodities resulting in higher market prices, price-fixing on the selling price, misleading or deceptive advertising or any other trading conditions and setting of minimum prices in form of retail price maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be compliant with the competition law, parties must be keen to ensure that exclusivity provisions and terms restricting the minimum resale prices are adhered to.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because if you are found guilty, you will be liable to a fine of up to Sh.10 million or imprisonment for a term of up to 5 years or to both. \n",

    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered why Kamande is so expensive in Kenya? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, there’s just one reason: Kamande farming is not done anywhere in Kenya. Honestly, I don’t know why this is so because this country has the best climate and soil for growing these high value legumes. Let me explain this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kamande, which are called lentils in English, grow best in hot areas with sandy or sandy loam soils that drain water fast. Lentils are grown under large tracts of land in Australia and India. \n",
    "\n",
    "India consumes almost everything it produces and even imports some more. Australia exports to many countries of the world. In Africa, this crop is grown commercially in Ethiopia, Sudan and South Sudan.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Best climatic conditions for growing kamande*\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at these countries that produce lentils in large quantities, you will realize that their climate and soils are very similar to what we have in Eastern and North eastern Kenya, parts of Rift Valley and Nyanza. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kamande requires at least 6 hours of sunshine daily, of which we have more than 10 hours every day of the year in Kenya. It grows best in hot areas and is very tolerant to drought conditions, so areas of Ukambani, Garisa, Wajir, Siaya, Kisumu, Narok South, Kajiado and the entire coastal region would be ideal for lentil farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How long do Kamande take to mature?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Lentils are very fast growing taking only 80 days in hot areas and at most 110 in cooler areas to harvest from the day you put down your seeds.\n",
    "\n",
    " Yes, I know that is crazy because most of the crops people run to for fast money take as long as 5 months. It definitely would be a faster money maker compared to onions and tomatoes, and much easier to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What do you need to produce Lentils?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Seeds, land preparation and planting*\n",
    "\n",
    "The kamande you buy at the supermarket or at the cereals shop are the seeds you need for planting. Your land will need to be ploughed well to have fine soils since the seeds are small. \n",
    "\n",
    "Drill lines of about 1 to 2 inches deep with a spacing of 45cm from one line to the next. Drop the seeds in these lines at a spacing of approximately 1 inch from one seed to the next – well that is more like sprinkling the seeds inside the small furrow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just ensure that the seeds are not too close to each other. Cover the seeds with about 1 inch of soil. You will need 12 – 15 kilos of seeds to plant 1 acre.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Best time for planting Kamande*\n",
    "\n",
    "The best time to sow your lentil seeds is during the onset of the rains. Since this crop doesn’t require a lot of water, it can grow very well over the long or the short rainy season. \n",
    "\n",
    "The seeds will germinate from the 10th day. Contrary to what most people think, you do not need to support this crop. The plant grows to slightly higher than 1 foot (30cm) and thus is able to stand by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Taking care of lentil plants*\n",
    "\n",
    "Any serious farmer will always start with a soil test. This will help you know if you need to add fertilizers, the type and in what quantities. Kamande is a short term crop hence you may need to have the soil nutrient balance and pH levels right before starting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weeding between the rows will definitely be necessary. This will not only help to reduce competition for nutrients but will also help to keep pests away. You also don’t want to harvest other wild seeds together with your lentils.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pests and diseases that affect lentils*\n",
    "\n",
    "The kamande plants are also susceptible to common beans pests such as worms, thrips and aphids. The good thing is that there are many safe pesticides you can get from agro-vet shops to control these pests.\n",
    " \n",
    "However, the most important thing is to closely observe your farm and scout regularly for signs of these pests. Pests are best dealt with before spreading too much in your farm. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can always talk to Richfarm agronomist on 0724698357 if you need any help with pesticides.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Harvesting lentils*\n",
    "\n",
    "The lentils are ready for harvesting when the plants turn brown and dry. At this stage, the plants and ponds will produce a dry matter rattling sound if shaken. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to be very careful when plucking the plants off the soil to avoid cracking the ponds and losing some of the seeds. For small scale farmers, kamande can be harvested in the same way beans, cow peas or green grams are harvested – placing the dry plants on a drying mat and shredding the seeds out with long sticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For large scale farming, combined harvesters are the best for harvesting the seeds. These harvesters will cut off the plants, shred the seeds out and clean off the chaff. The expected yield of lentils per acre in Kenya is about 600 to 800 kgs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Profitability of kamande farming in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take the very conservative figures: assuming you achieve a yield of 600kgs and sell each at a wholesale price of 150 per kilo, you will have a turnover of 90,000 from an acre in about 3 months. \n",
    "\n",

    "Most people have now realized that the way to prosperity in this era of ours is to be an entrepreneur.\n",

    "Not long as men and women discover this truth do they come in contact with another mighty mountain.\n",

    " _How Will I Get Capital?_ \n",
    "\n",
    "This question is the most often asked question by many intending entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that, capital is never scarce. Capital is so much in the world that I can liken capital to water.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know someone may want to disagree with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone will ask who are you and what gut do you have to claim that capital isn't scarce?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I am Justine Nyachie. I am an entrepreneur, Business Mentor and a business consultant.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know my story you will know that I was born by a tea farmer in a poor local village in Kisii.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might as well know that I was born a sickly boy, praying for death because I was born with a strange genotype (SC).\n",
    "\n",
    "What you might have also known about me is that I started my first business at the age of 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "How did I get capital to start a business as a boy of only age 15?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, let me tell you. I didn't ask my father for capital, nor did I tell any of my family members that I wanted to start a business (because they wouldn't allow me, they wanted me to be a professor).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tactics similar to the one I used to get capital at age 15 are very much available for men and women who are 25 to 30 years old today, but they don't know about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why don't they know?\n",
    "\n",
    "If truly capital is plenty in the world, why are most people unable to get it?\n",
    "\n",
    "I won't answer your question. I will instead ask you some questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we buying water? Why are people dying of thirst?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you and I know that water is so much on earth that its covers more than 70% of the earth surface, shouldn't we wonder why we are still paying for water?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a thing like water that is too much available but at the same time so scarce that we are paying to get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why can't people get capital to start their own businesses?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they lack the knowledge of how to get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not only get capital from people around me, I got and am still getting capital from total strangers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn't just get capital at age 15; I got capital again, again and again, till this day.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, as at the time of writing this article, there are three different people who are willing to support my businesses with their resources but I told them, \"hold on please\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do I tell people to hold on when they are willing to support my business with capital?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because capital is plenty.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you will allow me to show you the simple tactics you can apply to get capital, you will get to a point where people will be calling (almost begging) you to accept their resources for your business.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mali Mali business is a common business venture in Kenya. Whether it’s in a local shopping center in a residential area or in a big shopping center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a one-stop-shop that offers a wide variety of household items can make you a good amount of money. Some of the mali mali enterprises that have grown earn about Ksh.800,000 a month. Some of these enterprises were started with as low as Ksh.3,000 meaning you don’t need too much money to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mali mali business can be started with as low as Ksh.5,000 and grow to an enterprise that earns you over Ksh.50,000 or even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Esther Wanjiru runs a small mali mali store in a local shopping center in Ruiru and makes good money every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I started my business in 2013 and I have been in this business for seven years now. When I started, the economy was not as bad as it is now. But, I didn’t even have money when I started. I only had Ksh.5,000 and that’s what I used.\n",
    "\n",
    "I just bought a few items to stock up and noticed that the items are actually selling. From then on, I started adding my stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before my mali mali store, I ran a kerosene pump business. I never got the satisfaction I wanted and decided to divert to mali mali. I got the idea from my sister who ran a mali mali business and was making good money from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "She told me when I listen to my customers and give them the items they needed, I would grow my business and make money.” Esther.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Permit*\n",
    "\n",
    "“I did not pay for a business permit when I started my business. Considering how much I had as capital, I couldn’t afford to pay for a single business permit.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I now pay Ksh.4,500 annually to the county government annually. I used to pay Ksh.3,500 the first two years but the fee was increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I acquired my business permit, I had issues with the county council and it was not a good experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Location + Rent*\n",
    "\n",
    "“When looking for a location to set up your mali mali business, look for a place that’s populated. Look for a place near the road. Don’t set up your store somewhere customers cannot notice you with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as you set up your store, make sure your display looks good and is visible. Your customers need to know what you are selling, even without being told.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for locations with the need you want to meet. Think of business centers and local shopping centers. Consider locations near residential areas, colleges, and universities where  people in the area will need household items.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I pay Ksh.4,000 for my store per month, and the space is good enough for me.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Esther’s store is located in the interior and a similar store near the highway on the other end would cost double that price. So, different spaces in different locations will vary in price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, remember to choose a location that provides you an outside space to display your items.\n",
    "\n",
    "*First years of business*\n",
    "\n",
    "The first years of business for an entrepreneur especially a small business entrepreneur are never easy. Most businesses fail in the first year of business for so many reasons. You have not yet established your footing in the market and you don’t have an established customer base.\n",
    "There are cash flow issues, management issues and the business might struggle to sustain itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "“My first year of business was not too bad for me but it was not too good either. You are new in the market and customers don’t trust you yet. But when a customer comes in, buys an item from you, and discovers its good quality, they will keep coming back.”\n",
    "\n",
    "*Supplies and stocking up*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mali mali store is all about your stock and what you have for your customers. They need to find what they are looking for if you want to sell and make good profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning, you might not have so much stock but as time goes by, work towards increasing the quantity and variety of items. For household items mali mali store, think of all that people use and need in their houses. From kitchenware to cleaning items. There is a vast variety of what you could stock in your store.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to be aware of the different places you could connect with the right suppliers and get quality items.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You don’t have to stock everything while starting. Stock items that will obviously sell. Items like buckets, basins. Whether you are spending Ksh.7,000 or Ksh.10,000, stock up the necessities first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn to listen to your customers and with time, you will add to your stock list and bring what your customers actually need. You will know what sells and what doesn’t sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "I get my items from the Kamukunji market. From my experience, Kamukunji is the best place to get your items at wholesale and at an affordable price. While re-stocking my store, I spend about Ksh.20,000, or even more depending on the timing.”\n",
    "\n",
    "*Challenges*\n",
    "\n",
    "Staring and running a mali mali store has its own challenges just like any other business.\n",
    "\n",
    "“While starting, the main challenge is how customers don’t trust your business yet and still prefer where they are familiar with.\n",
    "A customer will pass by your shop and come back carrying an item you sell in your shop and don’t buy from you even if you are the nearest to them. You start wondering whether customers are even noticing you. But once they start getting used to you, that’s it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, some customers are really difficult and you have to keep your cool even when they are getting to your last nerve. You have to be nice to them and make them feel welcomed to your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge is customers wanting to get items on credit and end up never paying you. Some pay half and never finish up their debt.”\n",
    "\n",
    "*To aspiring mali mali entrepreneurs*\n",
    "\n",
    "“Avoid giving goods on credit at all cost. Giving items on credit can actually collapse your business if you are not careful.\n",
    "\n",
    "While shopping to stock up, choose good quality items. For example, you will find a variety of basins in Kamukunji but some are of really poor quality and break easily. Take the basin that’s of good quality even if the price is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t compromise quality at any point in your business. Poor quality items will make you lose customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to give your customers the best experience when they come to your store even if they are the difficult type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, avoid mismanaging your money. Keep an account of every shilling that comes in and goes out of your business. Additionally, let business money be business money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing, don’t let people who are not in your business such as your family dictate how you do your business. Be in control of your business.\n",
    "I ran my business by myself and I love it. It makes accountability easier and gives you more control over your business. It’s not easy for you to just take business money and use it somewhere less important.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“When your customers get what they need and what they are asking for, you could make good money. Think of Ksh.30,000 and above every month coming from your small mali mali business. But if you go big in this business, you can make over Ksh.100,000 per month. Also you can grow into a wholesaler or importer.”\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Thoughts*\n",
    "\n",
    "A small mali mali business is a good venture you can make money from whether as a side hustle or a full-time job. You could start small and grow your business into a big malimali enterprise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make it in this business, ensure you have a one stop shop where you sell a wide variety of household items.\n",
    "\n",

    " \n",
    "“I don’t have the capital.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Nobody wants to give me capital.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The banks have turned me down five times.”\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the most common reasons people give for not starting or growing their businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to capital is arguably the biggest threat to entrepreneurs around the world. And every year, thousands of passionate people – especially in Africa – give up on their business ideas, projects and dreams just because they can’t find capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "But is lack of capital really the “serial killer of business dreams” that we claim it is?\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience and opinion, lack of capital is largely a convenient excuse. In fact, I have found that capital is actually more abundant and available in today’s world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is, many entrepreneurs who need capital don’t know where to look for it. That’s why the real problem is actually lack of awareness about where and how to raise capital, and not lack of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last decade, more capital has been flowing into places like Africa like never before. In 2019, the continent received up to $276.5 million in startup funding. In 2021, the number rose to $366.8 million.\n",
    "\n",
    " And these numbers are just for tech startups alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the long term, I really don’t see anything that would stop these capital flows from rising higher and higher as the years go by.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I dispel the myth of capital by showing you an example of a Kenyan entrepreneur who successfully raised funding to start, grow and expand her business.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don’t just want to give you the facts. Facts can be boring, especially when you are desperately looking for capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, I will be sharing the success story that proves just how possible it is to raise capital even in tough and challenging environments like Africa. \n",
    "\n",
    "And if these woman can find capital in Africa, you can find it too!\n",
    "\n",
    "But this article isn’t just about a story. It’s about fixing the misconceptions and wrong notions you have always had about raising capital for your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Story of Lorna Rutto*\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2010, she quit her bank job to start a waste recycling business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her company, EcoPost, collects and recycles waste plastic into aesthetic, durable and environmentally-friendly fencing posts that serve as an alternative material to timber.\n",
    "\n",
    "But her business would have remained a dream without the financial support of international and local investors and NGOs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year, hundreds of international and local organisations support businesses that tackle issues such as environmental pollution, illiteracy, disease and other social problems. They usually provide grants, donations, loans, equity or even training and advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is, many African entrepreneurs don’t know about these funding opportunities, and as a result they don’t apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in 2010, Lorna applied for and won a Ksh.600,000 SEED Award which served as start-up capital for her business.  In the same year, she won a grant award of Ksh.1.2 million from the Enablis Energy Globe-Safaricom Foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "She also won a business plan competition organized by the Cartier Women’s Initiative, and received a prize award of Ksh.1 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, her business attracted an equity investment from the Blue Haven Initiative and the Opus Foundation amounting to Ksh.5 million. This was used to expand the business and purchase advanced recycling equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our upcoming training on Raising Business Capital (more details about the training will be at the end of this article), we shall reveal the reasons why these organisations are eager to support businesses in developing countries by giving away millions of dollars as grants, donations, loans and equity every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ready to learn how to raise capital?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Like I said at the beginning of this article, “lack of capital” is not the problem. The real problem is “lack of awareness.”\n",

    "\n",
    "Rabbit farming has taken the Kenyan market by storm over the last few years; but like with any other upcoming business idea in Kenya, farmers are encountering a couple of challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to that, i did some research on this agri-business opportunity. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to put down a short informative article to help young farmers (as well as buyers) who want to venture into rabbit farming in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Types of Breeds That Do Well in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI), there are three (3) breeds of rabbits in Kenya; California, Chinchilla and New Zealand white. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flemish Giant is also quite popular around the country. Chinchilla is a grey-brown breed and is preferred because it has a large mature weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most rabbits reach maturity in 5 months and achieve slaughter weight in just 3 months. Rabbit’s reproduce 3 to 4 times annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Zealand and Californian are popular because they can be relied on for fur as well as meat. Chinchilla is preferred for meat because of its large mature size.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Benefits of Rabbit Keeping*\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the high turnover that is characteristic of this field of business, rabbits have numerous benefits. First, their meat is categorized as white meat. Rabbit meat is white, high quality, easily digestible and low fat. It has low cholesterol and high protein compared to most other meat. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rabbit meat provides low calories per kilogram of meat consumed than pork, turkey, chicken or beef.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rabbit urine is used both as an insecticide and fertilizer. Their skin and fur can be used in the manufacture of fashion items. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rabbit droppings serve as tilapia food for those with ponds. A 20kg sack goes for between Ksh.50 and Ksh.200. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some local agrochemical companies have shown interest on Rabbit droppings but inadequate supply has always proved to be a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "{Rabbit meat has 20.8% protein as compared to lamb meat which contains 15.7% and beef 16.3%}\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cost of Rabbit Farming*\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of rearing rabbits depends on the type of system you use. Feeds are a major cost because rabbits consume about 25 grams of pellets per day. \n",
    "\n",
    "This translates to 2.25Kg in 90 days. On average 2Kg of rabbit pellets cost between Ksh.90 and Ksh.150. These feeds can be easily found in local agrovet shops and supermarkets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can feed them on vegetables. An average rabbit feeds on 2 leaves of sukumawiki (Kales) per day. You may also feed them on carrots. Aside from the cost of feeds, you should also add other costs as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cost of labour (constructing rabbit hutches)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Depreciation of hutches\n",
    "\n",
    "*Transport to the nearest rabbit market\n",
    "\n",
    "*Regions Where Rabbit Business Thrives*\n",
    "\n",
    "Rabbits can be kept in virtually any part of Kenya provided they are housed properly and protected from predators. The Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries will be able to furnish you with specific information like – where to source the right species and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kindly visit your nearest ministry offices to inquire more on requirements for starting up rabbit farming in your area.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Where to find Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding market for Rabbits has proven to be a challenge to most farmers in Kenya. To some extent this can be blamed on poor flow of information from the sellers to the buyers (and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, there are two different avenues that you can use to sell your Rabbit products. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can sell through local companies that have established themselves as an authority in this line of business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rabbit Republic is one such company. Benida Foods is yet another example of a company that deals with rabbit marketing in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way to market your rabbits is through direct marketing. In that case you would have to visit big hotels and research centers looking for market. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to approach supermarkets in your area and request them to sell your stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "To market rabbits you need certification by the Veterinary services department (MALF), Kenya Bureau of Statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "One place to find market for rabbit meat is at local hotels. Most 5 star hotels are looking for consistent suppliers. You only need to visit several of these hotels in your area and talk to them about your farming business. Rabbit meat retails at a price range of Ksh.500 and Ksh.700 per kilogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from the Export Promotion Council (EPC) shows that demand for rabbit meat globally has not been fulfilled. For this reason, farmers with less than 100 rabbits are being urged to form groups at the county level in order to strategize on how best to supply other countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally;*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many factors to consider before you venture into Rabbit farming in Kenya. I advise you to carry out thorough research before you rush to invest in any kind of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Raising Business Capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called, *RAISING BUSINESS CAPITAL*\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The demand for organic foods in Kenya is on the rise amid the increasing health-conscious consumers who are keen to know the origin of what they are buying to eat.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has caused a ripple effect in organic farming which is currently increasing very fast to meet the ever-growing organic markets in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, one of the approaches in organic farming is the application of biological methods to protect and provide the much-needed nutrients to plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these plant nutrients include vermicompost and vermiliquid which can only be found from red earthworms which ingest food scraps and other organic waste at a rapid pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearing these worms can create a lucrative business for anyone keen to make cool cash from less capital investment as it is not costly to establish and it is, at the moment, not crowded.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Requirements*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good to always start small and increase investment as the business peaks. You will therefore need a raised structure built of polls and timber offcuts which are cheap and, in some cases, readily available especially in a rural setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together with some nails, this structure can cost you not more than Ksh.5,000. You will also need some containers like old buckets or cans of 10-20 litre capacity where you will collect vermiliquid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Redworms feed on organic wastes such as fruit peels and vegetables which you can find free of charge hence you will not need to buy feeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starter worms can cost you Sh.2,500 getting them from some established vermiculturist, a redworm farmer. This is also the time you may take, by observing, some simple tips of improving your redworm rearing venture.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these, you will be better placed to start and have a system of collecting vermicompost and vermiliquid from time to time.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Possible returns*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can harvest 100 to 150 kilos of vermicompost and 80 to 100 litres of vermiliquid per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sell a kilo of vermicompost at Sh.70 and a litre of vermiliquid at Sh.150 which will give you close to Sh.25,500 a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the food craps available, the worms can really multiply very fast and within a short time, you will also start selling them to other growers and make more cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experts assert that a kilogram of earthworms (approx.1,500 worms) fed very well and given the right moisture and protection from predators at the beginning of January, can multiply and increase their number to approximately 4,000 kilograms at the end of December.\n",
    "\n",
    "And after a year of rearing, a farmer can produce up to three tonnes of organic fertiliser every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, a kilo of redworms goes for Sh.200 meaning if you can sell a minimum of 10 kilos a month, you will be earning Sh.20,000. Add this to Sh.25,500 from vermicompost and vermiliquid, you will be pocketing over Sh.40,000 a month.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Last word*\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, as previously indicated, this is a business which is less crowded at the moment meaning you will possibly not get it hard to find customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These customers include organic farmers of those who need biological control measures for pests and diseases attacking their crops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding vermicompost and vermiliquid to the soil reduces insect pests and plant diseases in a certain field and greenhouse crops including corn, wheat, pea, cucumber, and tomato, according to Dr Freddie Acosta, a Senior Lecturer of Technology and Innovation Management at Strathmore Business School.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is no excuse you can give for not starting a business. This idea requires little starting capital and is still a soft target that you can take on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, nothing good comes on a silver platter. Don’t just sit there and complain. Start small and dream big.\n",

    "22/02/2022, 12:34 pm - +254 742 304047: *AGRICULTURE; SOLUTION TO UNEMPLOYMENT IN KENYA AND AFRICA*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pay close attention to media in recent time, there has been so much motivation and encouragement from various governments and individuals, advising the unemployed youths in Africa to look at Agriculture and farming as solution to the unemployment problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is my opinion about this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I think the first two important things we should tell our unemployed population are usually omitted, why becoming a farmer is the third thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going further, what is Agriculture?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia defines Agriculture as “cultivation of animals, plant, fungi, and other life forms for food, fiber, bio fuel, medicinal and other products used to sustain and enhance human life”\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above definition, we can see that farming can be grouped into two major division: planting of crops and rearing of animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss more on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I said earlier, there are two important things we should tell African youths, even before advising them to become farmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are those first two important things?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have to let our unemployed youths see farming and agriculture as a business. Yes, business not a dirty thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens is that whenever you mention “agriculture”, the picture that appears in the brain of an average African is the picture of his grandfather holding a jembe or the picture of his father struggling in a maize farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "He hates this picture, so he resists any idea of becoming a farmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we have to do, if truly we want our unemployed population to venture into farming is to re-orientate them as per what agriculture is… in the modern world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modern world, farming is business.\n",
    "\n",
    "My father was a tea farmer. I spent my first 11 to 12 years in a tea farm. I later moved to a nearby town with my mother but still I continued following my father to his other farms he had in the town.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know what it means, so if anyone suggests the idea of living like my father, I will resist the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you see, things have changed so much. Farming has been modernized and you can now become a millionaire as an agricultural entrepreneur.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will explain more about this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing I think we should do is to sensitize our unemployed youths the importance of entrepreneurial skill … if they want to succeed in agriculture business.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, our grandfathers needed not to be business-minded when they were farmers. All they had to do was to plant their crops. All they had to do was to rear their cattle and sell them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in our days, because we are trying to progress from a small scale farming to a mechanized, commercialized farming, then, business skills are very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my call to you my fellow African… seek to acquire business and financial education.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are well educated, you can get into agriculture business and any other business and become successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I mention education above, let no one confuse my statement for formal education. If you went through the previous education systems, chances are you were educated/prepared for employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are no more “good jobs” for our graduates, isnt it stupid that school continues teaching every child how to be an employee? But am happy our government has changed our education system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever I talk about education, you can be sure I am not talking about school. Am talking about acquiring knowledge from people who have made it in your area of business interest. Visit their businesses and learn from them or read a book they have written.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above two advices are well understood by our unemployed youths, then, we can give the third one which is about going into agriculture… as a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How profitable is Agriculture business?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just as complex as asking, how profitable is clothing business, cement business or real estate business. The right answer is… its all about you.\n",
    "\n",
    "It`s all about who you are and what you know about business and how to make it profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business world is not a place where 1+1=2. In the business world 1+1 can be 11 for someone and the same 1+1 can be 22 for another person. Thats why I said… its all about you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to improve your outcome and achieve something meaningful with your intending agriculture business is to educate yourself in the area of farming you are planning to go into, and most importantly, about business world as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why I said this is because, though you may have some huge capital and go into agriculture business today, you will have to deal with employees which requires great leadership skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to deal with some suppliers somewhere which has to do with human relationship and negotiation skills. You will have to deal with customers and the market place which is where the biggest work is.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will require that you know some things (or a lot of things) about marketing, branding and market positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever I see Africans going into business as though it`s a mere buying and selling, my heart bleeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business is NOT buying and selling. If it were, everybody would have been a millionaire. Business is an art. It has to be studied and understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who on earth will want to become a lawyer without planning to read some (a lot of) books? Who will want to be a medical doctor without planning to read some (a lot of) books? Why then do people think they can be successful in business without reading or studying about business?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give you my last advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, decide which area of Agriculture business you will love to venture into. Is it planting of crops or rearing of animals?\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, see farming as a business, not a dirty thing. Educate yourself by reading some good business and financial books. \n",
    "\n",
    "I love you and I wish to see you become a successful entrepreneur. \n",

    "\n",
    "For the past few years, most Kenyans have been warming up to entrepreneurship with a huge number of startups being launched and a majority of employed Kenyans having their side hustles.\n",
    "\n",
    "However you will agree with me that one of the greatest challenges facing entrepreneurs when starting out is access to capital. You also can’t rely on bank loans in Kenya due to high interest rates and having to provide collaterals.\n",
    "\n",
    "An opportunity that most Kenyan entrepreneurs haven’t fully taken advantage of though is the public funds provided by the government for helping young entrepreneurs get their startups up and running. These funds also come with limitless benefits such as zero interest on loans and business training.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the government has set aside more than Ksh.25 billion for the sole purpose of creating a culture of entrepreneurship among youth and women in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "Still, not too many Kenyans are taking up these funds and early this year, the government rolled out a sensitization campaign to encourage people to take advantage of the funds.\n",

    "A group could have 100% women or 70% women and 30% men. Even though the loan is interest free, the group is required to pay 5% administration fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "No collateral required – Unlike bank loans, the Tuinuke loan does not require you to provide log books or title deeds. Instead, the women serve as a guarantee to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial Training – The WEF fund places great emphasis on financial and business training for women. Actually, getting trained on business management skills by WEF officers is a prerequisite for loan application.\n",

    "Easily Accessible – You don’t have to incur insane transport costs to access the WEF loan. The funds are decentralized and can be easily accessed through your local constituency offices.\n",

    "Even though the fund has been tainted with a number of scandals concerning mismanagement and corruption, slightly over 800,000 youth have benefited from it since its inception.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a young entrepreneur, here are three YEDF loans you can benefit from;\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Constituency Based Loans – This loan is available to individuals and registered youth groups at the constituency level looking for funds to start up a business. It is also interest free.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Vuka Loan – This is a business expansion loan limited to youth who are looking to expand their existing businesses. It is the only YEDF loan where one is required to pay back with interest. The interest rate had been set at 8% until July this year where the interest rate was dropped to 6% which is still way cheaper than the current bank rates. The Vuka loan is open to individuals, partnerships and youth owned limited companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Bid Bond/LPO/LSO Financing – This fund is eligible to youth participating in government tenders. It’s open to individuals, registered youth groups, partnerships and youth owned companies. The maximum amount available for a bid bond is 2 million while for an LPO/LSO loan the maximum amount is 20 million.\n",

    "\n",
    "What comes to your mind when you hear about the matatu business? Do you see opportunities, chaos or both? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, irrespective of your perception of the industry, the fact of the matter is that this is not a business for the faint-hearted.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a bumpy ride but if you are ready to learn the ropes; then there’s nothing that can stop you from conquering it (business-wise). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you have to roll up your sleeves and get ready for a ride of a lifetime. A ride that can take you places if you play by the rules but one that can easily leave you bankrupt if you miscalculate your steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are 23 things about matatu business that nobody else will tell you.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Matatu business requires a hands-on approach. It may not be wise to venture into it if you are tied up in an office job from 8.am to 5.pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The minimum amount of initial capital you can expect to inject to get your matatu on the road is Ksh.500,000 (assuming you buy an old van which has been used locally for several years). But in order to operate comfortably, i would recommend Ksh.1,000,000 as starting capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you’re planning to purchase a locally used matatu (or a third-hand matatu for that matter), have a reputable mechanic accompany you for the inspection. This can save you some hundreds of thousands which could be incurred in replacing worn out parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fuel is the number one major expense in this business. An average 3L 14 seater matatu consumes about Ksh.4,300 worth of fuel for every 350 Kilometers covered. This figure may however vary depending on the make of your vehicle and the nature of driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The most expensive spare part is the engine, and when it gets to the end of its life, there’s nothing you can do about it. Always have some amount in your account sufficient to purchase a good ex-japan engine just in case the need arises. An average engine costs Ksh.300,000 and above.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You have to pay advance tax for your vehicle. This is approximated at Ksh.720 per seat per year. So if you have a 14 seater matatu you’ll be required to remit Ksh.10,080 to KRA per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The route your vehicle plies may determine how much you make. Profitable routes around the city of Nairobi have been identified as: \n",
    "\n",
    "Mwiki – Town\n",
    "Wangige – Town\n",
    "Rongai – Town\n",
    "Kikuyu – Town\n",
    "Embakasi – Jogoo Road – Town\n",
    "Kitengela – Town.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Some routes that are quite difficult to operate in mainly because of cartels include Kayole and Dandora.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. A 33 seater matatu is more profitable than a 14 seater for town service business. Vice-versa is true for long distance transport business.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. With a 14 seater van, and assuming the business is well managed, you can expect to make Ksh.3,000 per day on average, this may however increase during peak seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. The approximate pay-back time (i.e the amount of time you need to recover your capital) is 2 years although this can extend to 3 or 4 years depending on how well your matatu is managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Be careful when having your driver double-up as the fleet manager as this might cause conflict of interest which may negatively affect your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. It is ethical to pay your conductor Ksh.1,000/- per day and the driver Ksh.1,500/-. But it’s unethical and mean to pay them less than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. You need to set aside at least Ksh.3,000 per week (or let’s say Ksh.15,000 per month) to service the vehicle’s, oils, lining, brake pads, air filters and battery acid.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What determines whether you’re going to make profit or loss is how the fleet is managed. It is best if you manage the business yourself rather than leave it on someone else’s hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Although quite unfortunate to mention, traffic policemen are at the heart of this business and once in a while you’ll be forced to let them “eat”…this is quite an unfortunate trend and we hope the Anti-Corruption Authorities will be able to contain the situation soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Fines imposed on traffic offenses are quite expensive…you are better off complying with all rules and regulations or else you’ll end up winding up your business in less than 6 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. Always keep some money aside for emergencies…the matatu business is not the type to operate on a shoestring budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Unscrupulous mechanics and garage attendants can easily ground your business if not properly supervised. Make a point of visiting a few garages to compare the quotes. Also, build a good relationship with a few trustworthy mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. It’s recommended to service the vehicle after every max 6,000 kilometers. This will help keep it in good shape and hence your business will not be interrupted by unwarranted visits to the garage.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. You can easily burn your fingers in the first 6 months of the business. It’s therefore advisable to keep your other sources of income intact as the business may be unpredictable during this stage of growth…so if you’re employed don’t quit your job yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. It is always advisable to have your vehicle fitted with a GPS tracker so that you can monitor the number of trips it makes during the day. This is especially helpful if you spend the day attending to other needs and don’t have time to monitor how the matatu is operated. Manual worksheets may not be effective in nabbing a conniving crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. In order to join some of the well established matatu saccos e.g. Mololine, 2nk, North Rift etc. one is required to pay a token fee of in the range of Ksh.100,000 and Ksh.300,000. This token fee is meant to buy you a position in the franchise. If the Sacco is doing quite well (business-wise) then you can expect to recover this token fee in around 3 months of doing business.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a wrap…these are the 23 most important things you need to know about investing in Matatu business. You can go through them once again and weigh your options.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes back, December last year, I visited one of my friends. We grew up together and his dream had always been to become a journalist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now he is a radio reporter but the reality, I suspect had set in for him, he doesn’t sound as if he loves his job. More so, money doesn’t come as much as everyone thought journalists should have, so he was considering doing something else. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since he knows me to be an entrepreneur, he wanted my advice to which I generously gave by showing him how he could start an online business the same day we met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, he didn’t follow my advice, and I’m sure 99% of the people who will read this article will do nothing about it, but 1% is worth working for anyway, so let’s continue with this article as I show you how you can start an online business right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use the internet to teach others what you know*\n",
    "\n",
    "I love business. I started my first major business at age 15. Nothing has made me high as much as creating and selling things, concept or an idea. Business is my life. But I also teach business and make money doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "If today I’m a medical doctor, guess what I will be doing? I will be on social media especially YouTube giving people medical advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If today I’m a soldier, imagine what I will be doing? I will be on YouTube, teaching people about personal security and maybe warfare if the army policies allow me. \n",
    "\n",
    "If today I’m a musician, I will be here teaching people how to compose songs, perform on stage etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if I’m a teacher? Well, I know a lot of people on social media especially YouTube making money by teaching people English, Economics, Geography, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the only thing I know is how to draw? Well, search YouTube for DP Art drawing. What the lady does is to draw for you to see. As at the time of writing this article, she has 533,000 subscribers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about that for a minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don’t know any law in the world which says it’s a crime to teach others what you know. What I know instead is that, if truly you know something, you will love talking about it and you might even like teaching other people and what is as sweet as making money helping others while you do what you love?\n",
    "\n",
    "I mean, it is a win-win situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "My business articles have been shared all over social media and have been read by many Kenyans (both in Kenya and diaspora) and many other Africans all over African countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, most of these people will just read and move on, but a good percentage of them change their lives just because I share my thoughts with them. How else can anyone contribute in a little way to the world? Yet, you can make money doing so, and you can even start in the next 5 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It only takes about 30 seconds to open a YouTube channel, about one or two minutes to open other social media channels, and that’s it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Understand how the internet works so that you can promote your products and services there*\n",
    "\n",
    "More than half of the world’s population uses the internet every day, but a very tiny percentage of these people have an understanding of how the internet works. When you don’t understand something, how can you make good use of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "My life changed in the year 2009 when I understood that I could use a software to know what people are searching for on the internet. To even make me crazy, this software is for free. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I started thinking, if I can understand what people are searching for in my country, I can know what products or services to create and market to them. This singular information changed my life.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "About six years after I have been studying every aspect of entrepreneurship, I discovered that the same tactics we men are using to woo ladies (and which ladies are using to attract men) are the same tactics that smart entrepreneurs are using to get all the capital they need to start or grow a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why in our upcoming training on Raising Business Capital, I will be relating getting capital with getting a lady or man you love. (More details about the upcoming training will be found at the end of this article)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since love affairs between men and women are practical life`s situation all of us can relate with, you are going to enjoy this training. You will not only enjoy this training but it will change your financial life forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know getting a lady's heart is a weighty achievement than getting capital?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because a lady's heart is her life, if you get it you have gotten ALL she has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who on Earth doesn't know that human life is far expensive than all the resources on Earth?\n",
    "\n",
    "You think about it! When a lady decides to give her heart to you, she's simply saying, \"I give you my life\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Now examine it. There are some fundamental processes that lead you to getting a lady's heart. What if we can apply the same creativity that allows us to get ladies into getting capital?\n",

    "Yes, we can!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are wondering, but Justine (some people will say) getting a lady is easy, but getting capital is very hard.\n",

    "\n",
    "“Sweet melons are giving me sweet returns. One fruit weighing around two kilos retails at an average of Sh.130, and in a month I can sell up to five tonnes of the fruit,” says Mr Steven Ithau.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Ithau, the proprietor behind Ithau Farm along Nairobi’s Ngong Road, started off as a watermelon and mango farmer and only started growing sweet melon following his customers’ demand for the fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sweet melons have gained quite a following as more people become aware of their health benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fruit has cancer-preventive elements, reduces oxidative stress and kidney cell damage, which is particularly helpful for diabetes patients, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and is rich in potassium, a nutrient that helps control blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Benefits*\n",
    "\n",
    "Sweet melons, despite their name, have lower fruit sugar (fructose) than most other fruits, making them kinder to your waistline. Their collagen content also helps keep your skin radiant and firm, and helps in healing wounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For customers purchasing sweet melons wholesale, Ithau’s prices range from Sh.80 to Sh.100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before he started farming the fruit, he says he visited a company in Nairobi offering crop nutrition services to have his soil sampled to determine if it was suitable for sweet melon farming and get insights on the use of fertilisers.\n",
    "\n",
    "“To ensure proper growth of the sweet melon plant, you have to provide the plant with organic fertilisers, which can be achieved by using cow manure or chicken waste,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ithau’s main sweet melon customers reside in the leafy suburbs of Lavington, Kileleshwa and Kitisuru, and business is good, he says.\n",
    "Unlike the more common watermelons, sweet melons are light brown or yellow on the outside, have a faintly sweet smell and their flesh is soft and green.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Maina Kigutha, a grocer at Ngara Market just outside the Nairobi Business District, says that the fruit has high demand but is in low supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I sell all my sweet melons by the end of the day, with each going for Sh.200. The Asian community located in Parklands and Ngara areas are my biggest clients. In a day, I sell up to 50 fruits,’ he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Kigutha has also started slicing sweet melons and selling them in smaller pieces at lower prices to appeal to more customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I sell a slice at Sh.30 to Sh.40. This has increased the customer base for the fruit and boosted my sales.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This is more than the Sh.10 he charges for watermelon, and explains the price difference by saying that since sweet melon uptake is still relatively low, most people think the fruit is exotic and are willing to pay more for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you go about growing sweet melons?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Planting and care*\n",
    "\n",
    "The fruit requires rich soil. The melon vine also requires plenty of sunlight and heat for at least two to three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dig two-square-foot holes and put in four to six inches of manure or rich compost, add the sweet melon seeds and cover with soil.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Purchasing the seeds is quite expensive. I purchased 500 grammes of sweet melons seeds for about Sh.14,000, which is part of the reason the fruits fetch such a high price,” Ithau says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space each hole about 36 to 42 inches apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sweet melons require at least one inch of water a week as they grow, so keep the soil moist, but not waterlogged.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may stop watering them a week before you harvest as too much water in the final stages can reduce the fruits’ sweetness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, avoid walking between melon vines lest you destroy the leaves, which provide the sugars that sweeten the fruit. The more leaves on the vine, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if too many melons ripen on the same vine at the same time, their sweetness will be compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I prefer pruning some younger fruits to ensure that my melons have maximum sugar concentration,” says Ithau.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Harvesting*\n",
    "\n",
    "And how does he tell if his fruits are ready for harvest?\n",
    "\n",
    "“When a sweet melon ripens, it changes colour from gray to green to yellow. It also separates easily from the vine. Since the melon stops ripening when it is picked, you have to be careful you do not pick it too soon.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have picked the ripe melons, keep them refrigerated until they are ready for consumption. They can keep for up to two weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Make sure you do not wash them until they are ready for consumption to prevent them rotting or getting mildew,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ithau adds that insecticides and fungicides will be required to protect the crop from pests like cutworms and fungal diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "The ball is in your court. This idea is still a soft target that you can take on provided you are willing to put a little more effort than everyone else. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, nothing good comes on a silver platter. So psyche yourself up and go for it. Start small and dream big.\n",

    " \n",
    "Are you at a time in your business when it feels like you have hit a ceiling?\n",
    "\n",
    "You are about to learn how to grow your business again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some businesses grow up to a certain level and then just stop. In such circumstances, you may notice that your sales are not increasing; no matter how hard you try.\n",
    "\n",
    "This often doesn’t mean there is something wrong with your business; you just need to think differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists and marketing experts like to call it ‘market saturation’, a term which means that the demand and potential customers for your products or services may have reached their limits within your area.\n",
    "So, how can you get out of this ugly situation?\n",
    "\n",
    "This article reveals three tried and tested strategies you can apply to break through the ceiling, double or triple your sales and grow your business again.\n",
    "\n",
    "I shall also share a real life example of a local business (owned by a friend) that has successfully used two of these strategies to increase its sales and return the business to a growth path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you are comfortable with the current size of your business and don’t plan to grow it any further, you would love this article!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever find your business in a situation where you need to increase your sales and grow your business, here are a few options you will need to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Option 1 – Sell more of your current products and services to your existing customers*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there are ways you can squeeze out more money from your existing customers by offering juicy offers that make them want to buy more of your products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing experts like to call this a ‘market penetration’ or ‘concentrated growth’ strategy.’ Fortunately, I prefer to stick to simpler words that most people can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your existing customers are the reason why your business has grown to the size that it is. These people come to buy from you because your products satisfy their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a high influence over your existing customers because they may already trust and like you. It’s many times easier to sell to an existing customer than to another person who has never bought your products or enjoyed your services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is, most small business owners often take their existing customers for granted and only focus on attracting new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can you make your existing customers buy more? How can you use your influence over your customers to sell them more products and increase your sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at one very interesting strategy you can use to achieve this. It’s simple and very effective, yet it is often overlooked by many businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Loyalty Programs*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a friend (let’s call her Matilda) who took my advice and implemented a loyalty program for her beauty salon business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loyalty programs usually work best with businesses that have repeat customers. And a beauty salon totally fits that category because people will often visit a salon to have a makeover or haircut about once or twice a month (depending on customer preferences).\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the loyalty program worked for my friend was quite simple. First, customers had to register for the program to allow them enjoy the benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "After registration, any money spent by a customer adds up to his or her ‘loyalty points’. When these points reach certain levels, the customer enjoys special discounts on all services in the salon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more money customers spent in the salon, the higher their loyalty points rose allowing them to enjoy even higher discounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "What was the effect? Amazing! Customers started to bring their friends along to the salon and referred neighbours and colleagues because any money they spent would help to increase their loyalty points. This led to more sales for my friend’s salon business and enjoyable discounts for the customers. Everybody wins!\n",
    "\n",
    "Loyalty programs are a good way to further generate your customers’ interest in your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give them a reason to become your ambassadors and advertise your business. Rather than spend money on advertising that may yield poor results, why not recruit the people who already use your products and services to spread the word about your business?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your existing customers can help to grow your business if you give them a reason to. Find an interesting way to cultivate a loyal following with your existing customers and you will be amazed at the results!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Option 2 – Sell new products and services to your existing customers*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you have a business that sells women’s shoes. Fortunately, you have a steady stream of loyal customers who love to buy your shoes because they are high quality, fashionable and you treat your customers well.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there’s a limit to the number of shoes a single customer can buy. Are there other ways to make more money from your loyal customer base of shoe buyers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there is!\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about new products that are similar to the things you are already selling and sell them to your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Women don’t just need shoes. They also need handbags, clothing, lingerie (underwear), wrist watches, bracelets and several other accessories.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, they buy these other stuff you don’t sell from other businesses around you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they are already loyal to you, these customers would gladly buy all these other stuff from you if only you sold them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than remain a shoe-selling business, you can expand your business by offering products that belong to the same category as the product you are currently selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you have a loyal customer base, you can become a “women’s clothing accessories business” rather than a “women’s shoe business.”\n",
    "When Matilda opened her beauty salon business, she only provided hairdressing services for women. But women don’t just want to make their hair look good. They want other things too!\n",
    "\n",
    "Matilda noticed the opportunity to introduce new services that her customers would gladly pay for. She introduced new and related services like manicure, pedicure, facial therapy, nail treatments and several others.\n",
    "By introducing these new services, she transformed her business from an ordinary ‘hairdressing salon business’ into a ‘personal care and beauty salon business’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Matilda, to succeed with this strategy, you need to think of other products that your existing customers usually use in addition to your product/service. Instead of single products, think in terms of product categories. What other products will your existing customers be interested in and would happily purchase?\n",
    "\n",
    "These new products or services will give a new boost to your sales and you would have accomplished this by selling to people who already buy from you – your existing customers!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Option 3 – Sell your current products to NEW customers*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day, we are exposed to adverts in newspapers and magazines. We listen to advertising jingles on the radio and watch commercials on television. These types of adverts are like casting fishing nets into a wide ocean and hoping to catch something.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you may catch something but it’s not always the best use of your advertising time, effort and money. How can you be sure that the people who read, heard or watched the adverts will be interested in the product?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many businesses in Africa are usually limited by their physical location.\n",
    "There are products that already sell well in one city, town or village and will likely sell a whole lot more if they can be introduced to other locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your business stops growing, it may be that there are no more customers within your area or physical location. At that point, your target market may have reached its limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this situation, the only way to increase your sales and continue to grow the business is to find new customers. So, how can you find new customers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few ideas…\n",
    "\n",
    "*Spread out!*\n",
    "\n",
    "By spreading out, I mean you should look for ways to expand your products or services beyond your current location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a branch or new shop in another part of town.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simpler option is to find distributors/sellers for your products outside your present location. Introduce your product to them and use them as a channel to sell these products to new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the big companies love to use this strategy. Every day, new products are coming into Africa from overseas businesses because they see our continent as a source of huge growth for their businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their home markets are saturated and competition is often quite tight. To grow their businesses, these companies look for new markets with a fresh supply of customers and Africa meets these requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicles, food products, construction materials and more are increasingly imported from North America, Europe and Asia. Why are these busineses desperate to sell their products and services to Africans? The answer is to grow their sales and expand business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get online*\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet has changed the way we do business in today’s modern world. A business that would have been totally invisible to the outside world can now be found by people across the world via the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet has broken down the physical barriers that used to limit the growth of local businesses. With a simple Facebook Page, Instagram account, Whatsapp group or your own business website, you too can put your products and services in front of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s simple, cheap and relatively effortless! Get your business phone number out there. You never can tell who could contact you for business.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had a bead jewelry business, how would you normally sell your beautiful finished products to make money? Friends, family and neighbours right? If you are lucky, you could rent a shop in an open part of your city or town and sell a few hundred bead necklaces and bracelets every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "But by creating a presence on the internet and showcasing your products online, you would automatically have access to millions (yes millions) of potential customers for your beautiful bead jewelry.\n",
    "And what would it cost you to have access to such a huge potential customer base in today’s world? Little or nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Facebook page for example is free to set up and can expose your business to a huge global market that would have been impossible for you to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the internet, your potential customers are no longer limited to friends, family, neighbours and other people in your physical environment. You too can now sell to people in the USA, Europe and Far East Asia.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Now you know how to grow your business. It’s time to test these strategies!*\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple strategies I have shared with you in this article are part of the ‘Ansoff Product/Market Matrix’, a framework that is commonly taught (as part of corporate strategy) in University and business schools around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix is also widely used by marketing experts and business owners who are looking for new ways to grow their business.\n",
    "\n",
    "If big businesses already enjoy the benefits of applying these tried and tested strategies to growing their businesses, I wonder why small businesses shouldn’t do the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already own a business (or plan to own one) but you are concerned about growing your business, these strategies will surely help you.\n",
    "\n",

    " \n",
    "Most people remain poor, not because they don’t have the knowledge. Not because they don’t read business ideas and advice articles like the ones am posting in this group. But because they don’t get out of their comfort zones and put into practice what they have learnt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you finish reading this article, at least 8 out of 10 people will have done something that contributes to their future poverty. Only 2 out of 10 will have done what is required to remain prosperous in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question you need to ask yourself today is, “I’m I among the lucky 2 or the not-so-lucky 8?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The story of wealth creation is the back-bone of the structures that exist in our society today.\n",
    "\n",
    "At one point in time, we are all at the starting point (like in a marathon race). But when the START gun is activated, we all take off at different speeds, others go very fast at the beginning while others choose to go slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also others who are too lazy to start, so they start passing blames. So where exactly do you stand?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you among those who start off so fast only to tire at the 5 Kilometer milestone? Or are you a winner who runs with a strategy in mind?\n",
    "Read this short story of Pablo and Bruno and decide which side you belong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once upon a time, long, long ago, two ambitious cousins Pablo and Bruno were neighbours in a small village in Italy. The young men were best of friends and big dreamers.\n",
    "\n",
    "They would talk endlessly about how someday, they would become the richest men in the village. Both were bright and extremely hardworking. All they yearned for was an opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then one day an opportunity showed up. The village decided to hire two men to carry water from a nearby well to the town square. The job went to Pablo and Bruno.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each man grabbed two buckets and rushed to the well. By the end of the day, they had filled the cistern in the town square to its capacity. The village treasurer paid them their salary…2 pennies for each bucket of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This is our dream come true!” shouted Bruno. “I can’t believe how lucky we have become.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But Pablo wasn’t so sure. His back ached and he was extremely tired from carrying the heavy buckets. He did not like the idea of getting up and going to work the next morning. He decided to look for a better way to get the water to the town square from the well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next morning before they could pick their buckets and head to work Pablo said, “Bruno, I have a plan”.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Instead of carrying buckets back and forth for a few pennies per day, let’s build a pipeline from the well to the town square.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Bruno stopped dead in his tracks: “A pipeline? Who has ever done such a crazy thing?” Bruno shouted. “We have a great job ahead of us. I can carry 100 buckets a day and I make a dollar. I’m rich and satisfied. By the end of the week, I can buy a new pair of shoes. By the end of the month a cow. By the end of six months I’ll buy a new hut. Can’t you see we have the best job in town? We have weekends off and two weeks paid vacation every year. Our life is perfect. Get out of here with your crazy pipeline idea.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But Pablo was not easily moved. He patiently explained his ideas and plans to his best friend. Pablo decided to work part of the day carrying buckets and part of the day and weekends building his pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, he knew it would be hard work digging a ditch in the rocky soil. Because he was paid by the number of buckets delivered, he knew his income would drop. He always knew that it would take a long time before his pipeline dream would pay off. But Pablo gathered courage and believed in his dream.\n",
    "\n",
    "As time went by, Bruno and the rest of the villagers began mocking Pablo. Bruno was earning twice as much as Pablo, he had bought some shoes and a new hut for himself. He even bought a donkey and outfitted it with a new leather saddle. The villagers called him Mr. Bruno and they cheered when he bought rounds at the local pub.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Bruno took time off on evenings and weekends, Pablo spent his hours out in the cold digging his pipeline. The first 12 months Pablo did not have much to show for his hard work. The job was getting harder and harder because Pablo was working almost twice as much as Bruno.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pablo kept reminding himself that tomorrow’s dreams are built on today’s sacrifices. So day by day he kept digging, inch by inch. Inches turned to feet and then 100 feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Keep your eyes on the prize,” he kept thinking as he drifted off to sleep with the sounds of laughter coming from the village pub where Bruno was buying more and more rounds for his friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then after about 15 months, he realized that his pipeline was half-way finished, which meant he only had to walk half as far to fill his buckets. He used the extra time to work on his pipeline. He even had an hour long break every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bruno on the other hand was hunched in pain, his steps gradually slowed down. He was angry, sullen and suddenly he seemed to realized that he was doomed to carry buckets for the rest of his life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stressed; he began to spend less time at work and more time in the village pub. His friends would giggle when the town drunk mimicked Bruno’s stooped posture. Bruno seemed to have run out of jokes and he couldn’t afford to buy more rounds for the villagers as usual. He preferred to sit alone in a dark corner surrounded by empty bottles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally Pablo’s great moment arrived, his pipeline was complete! The villagers crowded around as the water gushed from the pipeline into the town square cistern. Now that the town had adequate supply of water, people from around the area settled into the village and the village prospered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pablo did not have to carry buckets anymore. The water flowed whether he worked or not. It flowed while he slept. It flowed while he played on weekends. The more the water flowed into the village, the more money Pablo made.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, Pablo had bigger plans. So he did not stop there, he even went ahead to build pipelines all over the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you would expect, the pipeline left his old friend Bruno jobless.\n",
    "End of story.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Lesson learnt?*\n",
    "\n",
    "We all live in a bucket-carrying world. But who are you? Are you a bucket carrier or a pipeline builder?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you get paid only when you work like Bruno? Or do you invest your time and resources wisely and get paid over and over again like Pablo the pipeline builder?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people focus on linear income in the name of salary, allowances and one-off payments. Wise men on the other hand focus on passive income in the name of royalties, interest rates, value addition and profit.\n",
    "Relying on linear income is similar to using buckets to fetch water from the river. With time, you’ll get too old and too tired to transport them to and fro and that means you’ll have to starve for as long as you don’t go to the river.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relying on passive income on the other hand is similar to building a pipeline. It may require a lot of work at the beginning but with time, you’ll no longer have to go to the river to get water – the river will come to you and you’ll not starve.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most fundamental principal of wealth creation that most (including you) are oblivious about.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are like most people, you are currently using the bucket-carrying plan. You are busy working hard for someone else who then pays you a small salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the bucket-carrying strategy is that it gets a bit tiring and monotonous with time. And you can easily find yourself jobless anytime – which means the concept of a “secure job” is actually an illusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intelligent, wealthy people are pipeline builders. Make a point of joining them today.\n",
    "\n",

    "26/02/2022, 6:36 pm - +254 742 304047: *THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT LUCRATIVE OR PROFITABLE BUSINESS IDEAS IN KENYA*\n",
    "\n",
    "There is this great misconception by people who are just planning to be business owners or who are new in the business world.\n",
    "\n",
    "They tend to see business as if some businesses are gold while others are stones. They tend to think, “If only I can get the gold, I will be rich in a short time”\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, if they can discover that profitable business idea, they will make it fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is ignorance!\n",
    "\n",
    "No business idea is gold and no business idea is stone, at least to a good extent. Selling cars in Kenya, we could assume is a very lucrative business, right? Yet, many people who are selling bottled water in Kenya are richer than car sellers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If my above analogy didn’t seem to make much sense, think about this one;\n",
    "\n",
    "I was with a friend of mine who is into poultry business last week and as we were talking he told me about some of his middlemen (or you call them middlewomen because they are women) who usually buy like 50 trays of eggs from him and other poultry farmers every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to him, these women make as much as Ksh.5,000 every day just by being eggs distributors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ksh.5,000 in 25 working days (not to talk about some of them who work every day) means Ksh.125,000 a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend confessed to me, “Even we who are working tirelessly on the poultry farm are\n",
    "not making as much as they are making”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get me right!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to say that poultry business is not profitable. This is to show you that business profitability is not really what people think it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "It pains my heart sometimes when I look at some great business ignorance in our day, but\n",
    "I know the cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why so many people assume that there are certain magical business ideas that are so much profitable and could make them millions in a short time is because so many people\n",
    "never for once consider or prepare to be an entrepreneur.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurship, for most people, is just a burden being placed on them by the lack of jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have prepared yourself well for entrepreneurship then you must already know that Businesses are NOT profitable; entrepreneurs make them so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of concentrating on searching for some magical lucrative businesses in Kenya, I will soon tell you what you should focus your attention on, but for now, let me make it very clear to you that business ideas are NOT like gold. No business is naturally profitable. It is smart business owners that make their businesses profitable. \n",
    "\n",
    "You take some time to look at any industry and you will see rich businesses and very poor businesses, in the same industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start from the richest industries in Kenya. Think about banking industries. There are very rich banks in Kenya and there are struggling banks too (don’t let me mention names), in the same industry, doing the same business.\n",
    "\n",
    "You think about petroleum industry in Kenya. Is every company and business there rich and successful? No.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are very rich players and there are very poor, bankrupt businesses, in the Kenyan petroleum industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Which other industry can I use as an example in Kenya?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remind me please. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, telecommunication industry. By far, the telecom industry is one of the richest industries in the world. But is this a very profitable industry?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is telecom business lucrative? Yes and no.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be profitable for smart business owners and it can never be for the weak or ignorant entrepreneurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about Orange, YU mobile and other failed telecom businesses who had millions, invested it and lost it in the Kenya telecommunication business.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about the great success of Google and the fact that Google has virtually become the king of the internet with their more than 100 products (Gmail, Youtube, and many complex ones you may not understand), you will be tempted to think that search engine is a very lucrative business.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that will be a very wrong conclusion because there are hundreds of people who ventured into search engine business and failed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, I have a friend who started a search engine business and probably never made a dollar from his venture. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because businesses are NOT naturally profitable. Businesses only become profitable when the owner (you) are smart and have business education (a lot of it) about the business you want to start or invest in.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s how great and profitable businesses are build.\n",

    "\n",
    "Have you read this great book ‘Think & Grow Rich‘, by Napoleon Hill?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book the author has outlined simple ways to getting rich. And one of them is the power of a group. \n",
    "\n",
    "The author found through intensive research that the five hundred richest men in the world all had one thing in common, they all belonged to a strong support group of like-minded individuals where they received the knowledge, advice, resources, contacts and emotional support to succeed in their creation of massive wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been proven time and again that behind every rich person unless they won the lottery belongs to a successful team. This team is either made up of a group of friends, colleagues or business partners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why must you always have a strong support group in order to reach your financial goals? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because it takes a great deal of knowledge, talent, resources, contacts and ideas to make a million shillings, and it is difficult for a single person working alone to do it all within a short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    " That’s where the Chama comes into play. If you join or form the right kind of chama with a goal to get rich; you will get there. A chama allows you to leverage on the collective experience of others, and leverage is the key to wealth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, people are your greatest resource to wealth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ever heard the story of the taxi driver who ended up owning an entire fleet of transport vehicles? Or the grocery lady who grew from one small kiosk to owning an entire estate of rental apartments? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, behind all those sweet stories are little-known financial institutions commonly referred to as CHAMAs or SACCOs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how SACCOs work – You become a member, set your saving goal and start saving. Let’s say you start today and target to save Ksh.50,000 in the next 10 months. After you reach that target, your SACCO gives you a friendly loan that is as much as 3 to 4 times your savings. So you get Ksh.200,000 which you can use to expand your business further. \n",
    "\n",
    "Easy, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of us know Umoinner Sacco, but do you know how this great sacco started?\n",
    "\n",
    "They started with nothing. In fact, they were just a group of slum-dwelling matatu touts who earned less than Ksh.400 per day. \n",
    "\n",
    "But today, they own a business that has been valued for not less than Ksh.500 Million. \n",
    "\n",
    "To most Nairobi residents the name Umoinner is a household one. Their buses ply the Nairobi-Umoja-Innercore route and are well-known for their outstanding graffiti. But beyond the glitter and glamour, this brand has a humbling story – one that will challenge you to always outperform your potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Umoinner was started by three members all who were touts (or manambas). In a recent television interview one of their co-founders attested to the fact that they started out saving at least Ksh.10 per member per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "With time however, more and more touts started to believe in this idea and soon they were able to make a contribution of Ksh.200 per day. It was a case of successfully making others believe in your idea even when you have nothing in your pocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "After about 10 years of saving diligently and sacrificing on some of the most basic pleasures of life, the first product of the Umoinner idea was born (2006). This came in form of a 14 seater matatu which cost them Ksh.600,000 to acquire.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, operating successful in the matatu industry would prove to be a rougher ride than they had expected. The members recall how their rivals once conspired with goons to run them out of business. But amidst all these challenges they learned to improve their strategies to survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three years down the line, their business was thriving but they still had one more huddle to tackle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2009, the Ministry of Transport issued a new directive that required matatu owners to organize themselves into SACCOs. So Umoinner decided to register a SACCO.\n",
    "\n",
    "What they didn’t know however is that only groups with more than 30 vehicles (matatus) were approved to form SACCOs. Umoinner did not meet this threshold at that time and therefore had to wait for 3 more years to get the final approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once they got this approval, they proceeded to brand themselves. Their matatus acquired a unique look. They invested in good management and with time the sky opened up for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, it had taken quite some time for them to make their mark on the road. In fact, cumulatively they had to wait for about 15 – 20 years to see their dreams come true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Umoinner stands tall as one of the best run matau SACCOs in the city. Their membership has grown from 3 to more than 81. Their fleet of buses now stands at well over 100.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Lesson Learnt*\n",
    "\n",
    "First believe in your idea even if you don’t have enough capital at that time just stay patient and keep learning. Most importantly, keep saving whatever little you have and use it to fund your dreams. Then if possible find a few people who believe in your dream and pool resource together in the spirit of Harambee.\n",

    " \n",
    "By 2022, it is estimated that 82% of all internet traffic will move towards video. This indicates that in less than 5 years, marketers are going to broaden their content from text-based to video.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also tells us that this is the perfect time to start a YouTube channel and cash in on it as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "With more than 1.57 billion monthly active users around the world, YouTube is the channel to build your personal brand as an influencer and boost your visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Video blogging is the new popular culture and YouTube has levelled the playing field and given everyone an opportunity to become a celebrity while getting an income from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you are looking to tap into this growing field, here are some few insights to get you off the ground;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Do Your Research*\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do before creating a YouTube channel is conduct some background research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3 basic questions to ask yourself are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why do I want to start a youtube channel?\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is my YouTube channel going to be about?\n",
    "\n",
    "*What are the current YouTubers doing that I can learn from?\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Why*\n",
    "\n",
    "People start YouTube channels for different reasons, the most common being to promote their business, build a personal brand, showcase their talents and share their hobbies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is great to experiment and try out different things but it’s better if you figure out from the beginning what exactly you want your channel to be about.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Topic*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you settle on your topic, ask yourself these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Do I really have passion for this topic?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is there demand out there for this topic?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is Youtube oversaturated with this topic? If yes, how can I stand out then?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some topics that are currently really popular on YouTube are: tutorials, vlogs, tech, product reviews, healthy lifestyle, how to’s, fashion, beauty, food, travel, comedy and life stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What are others doing*\n",
    "\n",
    "Take time to watch other people’s content in your field:\n",
    "\n",
    "*What kind of content do they share?\n",
    "\n",
    "*How do they engage with their audience?\n",
    "\n",
    "*What kind of comments do they receive?\n",
    "\n",
    "*What can you do differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Getting Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed your background research, and settled on what exactly you want to do on YouTube, you will need to have a few things in place before you are ready to click the ‘create a channel’ button, and these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A content plan:* This is a calendar complete with dates, topics, when to do the shoots and anything else that will go into creating your YouTube content.\n",
    "\n",
    "*A catchy and memorable name for your YouTube channel:* Your channel name is crucial since that is your brand. An important tip is to have the same username throughout your other social media channels to brand consistently. You can also use your other social media channels to promote your YouTube content but first study how each works so as to make the best of each channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Search Engine Optimization (SEO):* For people to discover and watch your content, you need to rank highly on YouTube search results. That is where SEO comes in. Ensure you always put up high quality videos that draw people to like, comment and share your videos which in turn boosts your search result rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The right keywords in your title and description box of each video:* Keywords are those words/phrases that searchers enter into a search engine and that is why they must be included in your title and description.\n",
    "\n",
    "*A launch date:* Set aside a day when your content will be going out. This is important because it will help your subscribers know when to expect new content. Start out by posting at least once a week and you can increase the frequency with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*A pipeline of ideas for future videos:* Always carry a notebook and pen to note down random content ideas so that you can build a pipeline of ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Basic Equipment*\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the things you need to be a YouTuber are basic video equipment. YouTubers make it look so easy but creating good quality videos that are visually appealing is harder than it seems.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you do not need to be perfect when it comes to the whole video production process. All you need is the right equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Camera:* Obviously, your most important equipment is a good camera. You do not need the most expensive camera when starting out but any camera that can record high quality videos of at least 1080p. You can get a good quality camera from Ksh.10,000 – Ksh.25,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Smartphone:* A smartphone with high resolution front and back camera is also a necessity. This is because at times you may want to shoot outdoor vlogs where you don’t necessarily need to carry a camera. A good smartphone will set you back Ksh.15,000 – Ksh.20,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Microphone:* It doesn’t matter whether your video is of the best quality, it’s hard to keep your viewers watching with poor audio quality especially since the built-in microphones in cameras and smartphones are not always the best. A lapel mic is the best to start with since it can be easily clipped onto your clothes. You can get a good one for only Ksh.1,800.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tripod:* A tripod basically ensures your video footage is steady. One goes for Ksh.2,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Lighting:* If you plan to shoot most of your videos indoors, lights are important to stabilize the brightness and mood of the video. One approximately costs Ksh.17,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Flash Disk:* As you keep shooting more footage, you will eventually fill up your computer space so having at least a 32GB flash disk can help with the storage. You can get one for Ksh.2,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Laptop:* It is essential to invest in a good laptop where you can edit and post your videos from. You can get a second-hand laptop at Ksh.20,000 but it’s better to invest in a brand new one that might cost anything from Ksh.40,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Video editing software* – After getting all your basic hardware, you also need to invest in a good video editing software for post-production. There are a variety of software’s you can use either as browser or desktop apps both free and paid. Most of them have a 30 day free trial after which you have to pay a fee. As a beginner, we recommend Wondershare Filmora which most youtubers use. You can also check out ShotCut, HitFilm Pro and Cyberlink Powerdirector 18.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Being a YouTuber comes with a lot of benefits:*\n",
    "\n",
    "You have the freedom and flexibility to run your channel as you wish. You don’t need a degree, work experience, office, etc. All you need is your equipment and great content.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can earn money directly from YouTube by enabling your channel for monetization through setting up a google adsense account where you can earn a certain amount every time YouTube runs an ad through your video.\n",
    "\n",
    "With time, you can approach or be approached by brands in your target content area to market their products at a fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need startup capital. Even if you do not have all the equipment from the beginning but start with what you have and you can get better equipment with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube is also the only video platform that makes it so easy to share content on other social media channels, embed videos in websites etc. This makes your video distribution so much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also get to meet and interact with a lot of new people in your comment section only if you actively engage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing your YouTube channel will also boost your confidence, you will gradually learn how to present yourself better, you will learn so much about the topic you are creating content around and all these will contribute to your own personal development.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Challenges*\n",
    "\n",
    "A few challenges you will encounter as a youtuber are;\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are starting from scratch, with no smartphone, no laptop etc, getting all the devices may be more expensive than someone who already has some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube is extremely time consuming. The whole process from planning content, setting up the shoot, shooting the footage, editing, posting, engaging with the comments takes more time than you can imagine. Especially if you have an 8 – 5 job with YouTube as a side thing, you may end up spending most of your free time working on your content\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that for sure you will not avoid as a youtube beginner is negative comments. Even the best of the best in this field get them. You just need to have thick skin, learn from the criticism and encourage yourself with positive self-talk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also be prepared for a lot of competition and at times even copycats. Don’t let this derail you though. Stay true to yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare yourself for a lot of work. As a YouTuber, you take the role of a whole production process. From graphic designer, video editor, social media manager, content creator, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we would like to stress is the numbers will not be encouraging initially. Your first videos will probably get 2 or 3 views but don’t obsess about that. Be consistent and your following will grow with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "Is being a YouTuber something you would consider?\n",
    "\n",
    "I leave it up to you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Raising Business Capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called, *RAISING BUSINESS CAPITAL*\n",

    "\n",
    "Coca-Cola is the largest soft drinks manufacturer in the region that has managed to build a reputable brand for the past 7 decades. \n",
    "\n",
    "The soft drinks giant started its operations in Kenya way back in 1948 along Industrial Area’s Addis Ababa Road and today has four branches namely Nairobi Bottlers, Coastal Bottlers, Equator Bottlers and Almasi Beverages Ltd which is a merger between Mount Kenya, Kisii, and Rift Valley Bottlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the fact that Kenya is being ranked as one of the top 3 markets for Coca-Cola in Sub Saharan Africa, today we are going to look at some of the requirements one has to meet if they are interested to be a distributor of Coca-Cola products ( Sparkling Soft Drinks, Minute Maid Juice, Dasani water and Monster Energy).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Story of Yasmin Kamir - Coca Cola distributor*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yasmin Kamir is the owner of Eriza Investments Limited located in Ukunda which happens to be one of the leading Coca Cola distributors in the Coast region. However, she was not always a soda distributor, prior to this she used to run a small hardware shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her journey to becoming a Coca Cola distributor started off in 2013 while she was still running the hardware. It was during her daily commute to and from work that she noticed that the people in her area did not have access to sodas which happened to be in great demand due to the hot coastal weather. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spotting a business opportunity, she approached the person who used to distribute sodas in the area in a bid to know how she can get into the business. The individual intent on discouraging her from venturing into the business, told her that if she wanted to start, she needed to buy 150 crates of soda from him and that she would get be getting a profit of Ksh.10 per crate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the low margins, Yasmin saw an opportunity and she got a loan to purchase the crates and she started selling the sodas and due to the demand business was good.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some time, she decided to visit the distributor in her area hopping to get better prices for the sodas that the ones she was getting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, she found that the person whom she had been dealing with was the authorized distributor in the area so there was no way she was going to get a better deal. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as they say, every cloud has a silver lining in that during her visit to the distributor, she got to find out that he was struggling financially and could not be able to buy enough sodas from Coca Cola to meet the demand in the area. \n",
    "\n",
    "This confirmed to her that indeed there was a good business opportunity in selling sodas. It was at this point that she decided to buy a pickup which she started operating with her husband where she assumed the role of a saleslady. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point business really picked up as she was able to serve the market that the official distributor could not satisfy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, Nick Maina who was the Regional Manager for Coca Cola (which she didn’t know at the time) passed by her shop and asked for Ginger Ale, Fanta Strawberry, Soda Water and Club Soda. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nick was pleasantly surprised that she had all these products yet their official distributor in Changamwe did not have them. The next time she saw Nick, he was in the company of top officials from Coca Cola who included the then C.E.O Mr. Ebrahim. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nick had seen the potential in Yasmin’s business, and he urged the C.E.O to help her expand.  Mr. Ebrahim must have seen Yasmin’s passion for her business due to the fact that he told her to come see him in his office the following day. \n",
    "\n",
    "When she got to the office, Mr. Ebrahim reiterated his willingness to help her expand her business, but the only problem was that she did not have the resources needed to purchase more stock. It was at this point that Mr. Ebrahim asked her whether she had a title deed that she could use as collateral to access financing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, she had a title deed, Mr.  Ebrahim referred her to a bank manager who then issued her with a loan of Ksh. 1 Million to facilitate her expansion and this is when her business really kicked off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Come 2015, due to her hard work, she was made a full distributor and if that was not enough, she was also given a new lorry on flexible credit terms by Coastal Bottlers to help her distribute the sodas. She was able to finish paying for the lorry in good time and even emerged as the best distributor in that region. \n",
    "\n",
    "Her hard work paid off in that when a new region opened up, she was appointed as the official distributor and she was also given another lorry on credit to aid in distribution. She also bought a lorry from her proceeds because she could see that her business was growing and there was a need.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018, due to her good performance in the areas that she had been appointed as a distributor, she was also given the Ukunda area to manage thus expanding her business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2013, Yasmin’s business has grown in leaps and bounds in ways that she could not have imagined, and she gives all the credit to Coca Cola for aiding in her journey. That is from giving her vehicles on credit at a time when she could not afford to buy a new vehicle for her business to giving her stock worth over 10 Million on credit which have all aided her to be the successful business lady she is today.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Capital*\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a coca cola distributor, one must be able to raise a startup capital of between 3 million to 5 million Kenyan Shillings. You should also be able to obtain a bank guarantee of 2 million Kenyan Shillings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Computer Literate*\n",
    "\n",
    "One must be or have staff who are computer literate so as to be able to compute stocks and sales reconciliation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Storage*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important aspect in any business, especially if you plan to be a distributor. You will need a place to store your products after buying them in order to make the distribution easier. In this case, you will need a warehouse facility comprising a minimum of 2000 Square feet storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Target Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be required to state your target market? Where are you going to be distributing the products? It is very important to state where your market interest lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Commitment to Nairobi Bottlers  limited Code of Business Ethics*\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of business ethics are explained in the coca cola website which falls under the Nairobi Bottlers Limited. The rules include:\n",

    "\n",
    "How many people have you heard say one of these sentences?\n",
    "\n",
    "“I had this brilliant business idea, but someone discouraged me about it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I wish I had worked for myself and not stayed employed all my life.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Or even, “I have so many great ideas but other people’s views keep discouraging me.”\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things that can stop someone from starting a business. But listening too much to other people`s views and over analyzing the idea are the worst two things that can keep you stuck at the starting line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever asked yourself why many smart people are employees instead of entrepreneurs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart people are good at digesting complex matters and finding solutions to the most challenging problems in the world. However, when it comes to entrepreneurship many of them are perennial failures. So, how comes they don't they use their incredible brain power to their advantage?\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Smart people know all reasons why something won’t work. For instance, they know all too well the risks behind each and every business idea out there. Given an opportunity to start, they overanalyze the situation trying to balance between its advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    " \n",
    "At the end of the day they don’t do anything concrete with their lives simply because they think they know too much. They keep analyzing and questioning other ideologies until the cows come home. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know why most not-so-smart people are great entrepreneurs? \n",
    "\t\n",
    "Because Ignorance Can Lead to Success. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes what you don’t know just might help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me share with you this two short stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Story 1*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the late 1990’s my uncle who was living in the USA got an itch to start investing. He had a decent sum of cash sitting in a savings account and he decided it was time to put his money to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The savings account returned about 1.5% a year so any return over and above that would be a successful investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time the dot com boom was at its inception and everyone was pumping money into tech stocks. My uncle didn’t fully understand the stock market and its inherent risks, so instead of investing in tech stocks, he purchased 15 acres of land in an upcoming neighbourhood near Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. \n",
    "\n",
    "He never lost a dime when the dot com bubble went bust, and even after the recent downturn in the housing market, his property is currently worth 8 times what he paid for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Story 2*\n",
    "\n",
    "About a year ago a friend of mine wrote an e-Book and put it up for sale on Amazon Kindle. I jokingly pointed out to her that all of the information in the e-Book was readily available on other blogs/websites for free and indexed correctly by Google. \n",
    "\n",
    "She was disappointed when I mentioned this but she left her e-Book up for sale anyway. We both assumed that it wouldn’t sell. We were wrong. The e-Book has been sold for a sum of nearly Ksh.250,000 since last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Lessons*\n",
    "\n",
    "Two significant Lessons:\n",
    "\n",
    "The popular way of doing things may not always be the best way. Sometimes taking action based on ignorance beats taking no action at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge is, no doubt, important. But occasionally what we know or what we think we know, hinders our ability to take action and make sound judgements. We become consumed with commonly accepted practices and thus fail to innovate. \n",
    "\n",
    "We follow the herd instead of thinking for ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing things the same way as they have always been done is a sure way of never getting ahead. Just because other people have done things a certain way doesn’t make it right. Quite often you will find the exact opposite to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being ignorant of popular opinion is a good mindset to be in. It allows you to form your own opinions based on first-hand experience. It gives you the freedom to think and to innovate. Oddly enough, the right kind of ignorance can give you the power to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Years from today, you will be old, retired and not as strong as you are now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you choose to pursue your ideas and achieve them, or simply relax and enjoy over analyzing ideas and listening to other people's views and discouragements, time will still pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter what you are doing (or plan to do), time will always keep moving; it’s a train that never stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "And what you do with your time is entirely up to you. Your goal in life should be to achieve your dreams while you still have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s up to you to decide how much of your time you want over analyzing ideas and listening to other people's views and discouragements to steal from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only time will tell.\n",

    "\n",
    "You have probably heard about “business” in the real world. You grew up to know that whenever anyone talked about “business” the person is talking about buying and selling of certain things.\n",
    "\n",
    "However when you got to know about the internet, you started hearing the term, “internet business” or “making money online”.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this work?\n",
    "\n",
    "How do people make money online?\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, do people truly make money online?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to the last question is, yes, people (including me) make money online. But I will write an article on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question I want to answer today is, what is the difference between the internet business and a usual business in the physical world?\n",
    "\n",
    "My answer to that question is, NOTHING. Really, nothing much.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know my answer is over simplified, so let me explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, there is so much noise out there about making money online and the whole concept is usually presented like magic. “Hey, give us or invest with us Ksh.10,000 and you will be making Ksh.250,000 every month with little or no work” is the common noise out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds magical, doesnt it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now forget everything you have been told before and let me tell you the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business, either in the physical world, on the internet or inside water is not different. The basic foundation and principles are constant while the only variable is the medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give me a second and I will explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of every business is people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wherever there are people, there must be business. Wherever people live, go or visit, there have to be businesses, and of course, the more the people, the higher the business opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why there are more successful businesses in cities than towns, and in towns than in villages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you have understood this, I can proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some years ago there was no internet, so there wasn't anything called internet business.\n",
    "\n",
    "When internet started, nobody knew (or only few people knew) that there will ever be businesses on the web. But the law of nature remains rigid … wherever people go business must be there.\n",
    "\n",
    "If tomorrow people start visiting the moon or living inside water, you will start hearing terms like … moon business, water business or something similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that i have explained the foundation of every business (wherever people live, go or visit, there must be businesses), now lets talk about the unchanging business principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you like go and start a business inside the sun or inside Pluto, there are constant business principles you must understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the basic business principles…\n",
    "\n",
    "*You must sell something*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easier to live without water than to make money (anywhere) without selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "If anyone ever presents any “make money online” idea to you and it doesn`t involve selling anything, you better laugh.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make money in the physical world by selling goods and services. The same principle is applicable online. We sell goods or services to make money online.\n",
    "\n",
    "While in the physical world, we sell more of physical goods and services, on the internet, we sell more of electronic and digital goods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still you have to note the word more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for instance, most giant companies on the internet are selling adverts to make money. Facebook, Yahoo! And google are examples you can easily identify with.\n",
    "\n",
    "But does that mean that advert selling is peculiar to the internet?\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever before you and I were born, there have been companies in the physical world which are selling advert space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, some earlier advert is dated to 4000 BC in India.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also take note that, though selling physical goods is common in the physical business world, many companies, small and large are selling physical goods on the internet. Jumia, Amazon are few examples you can quickly remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "My point here is, for there to be a business, there must be a selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The selling has to be of value … real value.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of “make money quickly” online is very common that most people making this noise usually dont tell people that you have to sell something of real value to make real money … anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have told you that you must sell. Now I am telling you, you must sell something that will help someone in one way or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to hear, “If you can just package this (especially information products) and price it #xyz, you will make #kkk each month”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats a lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, just like in the physical world, you can put together a crap, a junk, a fake product and start selling, but how far can you go with that?\n",
    "\n",
    "How much can you make with scam?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think you understand what I am saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have built a community of people on the internet. Again and again I have seen and heard people tell me, “thank you” after buying what I sold to them (on the internet).\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to understand what that means.\n",
    "\n",
    "It means you are giving value. It means people will come back again and again to buy what you are selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Nobody makes money from the first sales*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another business principle you must understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you understand this, you will never attempt selling crap or scamming people with substandard products or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody makes money from the first sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coca-Cola has been selling coke from 1985. The reason why that company is rich is because they sell again, again and million times again.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is just as real in the physical world as it is on the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "I love facebook and can you guess the reason why I love facebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "No. not what you think.\n",
    "\n",
    "I love facebook because I run wonderful adverts through facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I run an advert on facebook, I see result, very good return on my investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats why I go again and again to facebook and “give” them my money. Thats why millions of people all over the world are begging facebook with their money every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "If facebook was mediocre, it would have taken me one poor experience (or two if I was a fool), to say “I can never advertise on facebook again”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Millions of other people would have concluded this way and, you get it, facebook will become poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody makes money by selling one time and if your products/services are average (or worse poor), people will only buy from you once or twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "No exception to this rule either in the physical world, on the internet or inside Jupiter (if business gets there)\n",
    "\n",
    "*No quick riches … no*\n",
    "\n",
    "I really wish there is a way to make money very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would have used such a way and became a billionaire. I would have taught all my relatives, my friends, and you (don’t be angry I won’t teach you first. Lol)\n",
    "\n",
    "I know we are all eager to be rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no quick money, quick success or quick anything worthwhile.\n",
    "\n",
    "While quick rich mentality is not common in the physical world businesses, that is the main bait online scammers use to catch their victims.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am here to tell you, it`s a lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a business is like giving birth to a baby. It takes time for your baby to become a man.\n",
    "\n",
    "I really wish there is a solution to this “problem”, so that I too may use it (because I too wish to become rich, quickly), but there is non.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Business requires knowledge and skills*\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think of business (whether online or offline), just think about medical science or law profession.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is so much to learn, but instead of people seeing it this way, they usually see internet business as different.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a term I usually hear on the internet. It is “internet marketing”\n",
    "\n",
    "I fell for this term and thought, “the marketing on the internet is different”.\n",
    "\n",
    "I later discovered by experience that marketing is marketing, whether online or offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have read some of the best marketing books about the physical world business and when I started reading the so called “internet marketing” books, I discovered that they are nothing but the repetition of the books I have read.\n",
    "\n",
    "To succeed in business (online or offline), you need business knowledge and skills and note, the skills you need are constant regardless of the medium (internet or inside moon)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody can teach you everything about business\n",
    "\n",
    "Internet “gurus” are fond of saying, “Hey, give me #5,000 and I will teach you everything you need to know about making money online”\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is, nobody can teach you everything you need to know about business, whether online or offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why i usually encourage people to read financial and business books.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conclusion.*\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between the internet business and business in the physical world?\n",
    "\n",
    "The medium. Nothing much other than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "My advice for you is this.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever wish to be a successful business owner, get prepared and be willing to learn, try and fight.\n",
    "\n",
    "I love to use that word (fight) wherever I am teaching business because that is what it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe you can be a successful business owner whether on the internet or in the physical world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just understand that business is business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe I should stop here till when next I will share another life changing business article with you.\n",

    "02/03/2022, 2:08 pm - +254 701 711058: *BAD DEBTS ARE LIKE HIGH HEELS, WE LOOK FABULOUS WEARING THEM BUT OUR LEGS FEEL EXTREMELY PAINFUL.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Debt can be compared to your shoes. You have great heels that look fabulous, but hurt like hell. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have your flat shoes that appear boring, but are comfortable and you can still enjoy the use of your back in old age. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bad debts e.g car loans, furniture loans, holiday loans, wedding loans are like the high heels. We look fabulous in our cars, our furniture is the envy of all our friends but the monthly repayments we make are extremely painful. \n",
    "\n",
    "At one point in our lives we can all say we have lived beyond our means and we were able to recognize that fact. However some may be living beyond their means but they have no idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to find yourself in this kind of situation given the YOLO (You Only Live Once) mentality of today’s society and the need to fit into a particular class, created by lifestyle trends on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people live a lie. They drive big cars on loans that take them years to clear. They live in lavish apartments that they can barely afford to pay rent for. Others merely survive by relying on their family wealth and inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it may seem like they are doing better than you, you might be shocked to find out that they are spending sleepless nights hiding from creditors. You might be shocked to learn that they are stuck in a vicious cycle of poverty with no light at the end of the tunnel. The best kind of growth is the one that comes gradually.\n",
    "\n",
    "As much as it is good to fuel your growth through credit-finance, always make sure you have a healthy debt to equity ratio. This will help you enjoy life more, be more stable, achieve a better credit rating and above all achieve long-term financial success.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we all work so hard is to ensure we can afford a good lifestyle and that we can live in a good neighborhood. The unfortunate thing however is that what we earn may not always afford these little pleasures but we insist on getting them anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may earn a salary that can afford you a good house is say Ruiru but you cannot imagine having to tell your peers you live there because it may not be considered a posh enough neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "You therefore make the decision to live in Westlands or Kilimani or any other neighborhood that maybe considered leafy or posh. This in turn translates to you having to spend half or more of your income on rent.\n",
    "\n",
    " Financial experts often say you should not spend more than 28% of your income on rent. So if your take home salary is Ksh.30,000 per month, your rent should not be more than Ksh.8,400 per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rent is undoubtedly the biggest monthly expense for most young adults and families which is why there is a real need to keep it as low as possible. Such a recurrent expenditure should be limited to give room for other developmental expenses like investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are going through life with zero savings, you are living dangerously financially speaking. No matter how little your income is, you should be able to save a little of that money for a rainy day or for retirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If by the end of the month you have spent all your money and saving a little of it was the last thing on your mind then it is a clear sign you are living beyond your means and if not then you are well on your way there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial advisers generally agree that one should save at least 10 to 15 percent of their income at least for retirement if nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if your take home salary is Ksh.50,000, you should be setting aside at least Ksh.5,000 per month. If that is too high for whatever reason and you find you are having trouble setting aside even 5% of your monthly income, then there is a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continually setting a little money aside cushions you from life eventualities such as loss of a job or a sudden illness. Living with no savings can be compared to swimming in the big ocean without a life vest, you may survive for a while on your swimming skills but a big tide could end it all at any one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If by the end of the month you have already started taking things from your ‘mama mboga’ on credit and you keep calling your friends or colleagues for a soft loan to cater for your transport then you are definitely living beyond your means. \n",
    "\n",
    "Funding basic lifestyle costs using credit is one sure way to confirm you are living beyond your means.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter your salary, proper planning should ensure that the ‘little’ you get should get you through the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the money you take home lasts you the entire month, adjustments have to be made. That means no weekend binges on nyama choma and alcohol, no weekly take out because you feel too tired to cook, and no random trips with your boys/girls to Nakuru, Naivasha, Mombasa or any other ‘sin’ cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a budget helps you prioritize your money on what is really important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you one of those people who always wonder where their money went? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you can never account for your money then you are living beyond your means because you have no budget in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a budget, it is difficult to control spending and as such you will never be able to save or use your money sparingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "One should always live below their means. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not within but below. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means even if you can afford to live in a house worth Ksh.30,000 a month, if you do not absolutely have to, you can get a house for half that price and invest the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever found yourself at a point when you felt like everyone else was doing better than you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in college or University you used to be the most confident guy around. Always attending all lectures and getting top grades. \n",
    "\n",
    "By third-year, you had managed to get yourself a part-time job which meant you were above most of your classmates (financially-speaking). \n",
    "\n",
    "And on top of that, you managed to get a full-time job just a few days before sitting for your final exams. You did not “tarmac” and unlike your former classmates, you did not have to knock on endless doors hoping for a miracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "But your wave of success was short-lived, or so it seems, because just a few years down the line, the once broke guys started cruising around town with big 4×4 SUVs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ladies who you used to ignore suddenly became social media sensations – attracting numerous followers with each photo they posted on Instagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly, everyone seems to be doing better than you. This is despite the fact that you are working extremely hard in your middle-income job and trying your level best to save as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this story sound familiar? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if you think “YES that’s me” you probably would like to find out what changed. And as it turns out, you could be more of a victim of perceptions than reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are that, even though you are more successful than them, they own better phones than you.

    "\n",
    "In almost every community in Kenya, owning a piece of land has been a coveted investment and with increasing population, this has become even more urgent. The desire (or is it lust) by every Kenyan to own land or a home has reached alarming proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Kenyan now wants to own a home and stop paying rent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a land buying business can be a very lucrative venture. Demand for land for farming, building a home or just for speculation is very high all over the country. You can make a kill by buying land and selling off after some time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Land prices will always appreciate due to this unsustainable demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What you need*\n",
    "\n",
    "Land buying and selling business is very easy to start. You will not need any equipment. In fact you can even start without an office. What you will need is enough cash to buy the land. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your profit margins will be much higher if you buy in big acreage and sell in smaller plots. You may choose to register a company or just do it as an individual, any can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need a good lawyer. Please don’t just engage a lawyer because he is a “lawyer”. Look for a lawyer who is experienced and conversant with conveyance matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are matters relating to land laws, transfers, succession, land boards etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Operation*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I proceed further, may I add that you will be safer dealing with land that has a title deed, one that is duly registered by Ministry of Lands. This is the most recognized form of ownership of land in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try and avoid land that has no original title deed. Do not entertain documents such as allotment letters, share certificates or such like documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may regret later.\n",
    "\n",
    "This land buying and selling business is very simple. What you have to watch out for is fraud and inflated prices. Land has no standard price, the prices will mostly depend on demand, location, developments, rumour, fear, seller circumstances and many other factors which you should acquit yourself with.\n",
    "\n",
    "This business has many con-men and con-women, so be on the look out always. Always verify every information and documents that you come across or you are presented with. Never trust any seller, do all background checks and searches yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I said earlier, buy large portions and sell smaller portions. Scout for land in counties such as Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu and others and buy large portions such as 1 acre, 5 acres, 10 acres, 50 acres or even 100 acres, depending on your budget. \n",
    "\n",
    "Engage a reliable land surveyor to confirm the size, locate the beacons and identify the piece of land in the larger map of the area. This will be to ensure that you are buying land that exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having confirmed the actual existence of the land on the ground and on the map, it may be safer to confirm with the neighbors and the local administration or county officials that the land is not earmarked for any public utility or is under any dispute. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure the number on the map corresponds with the number on the title deed. Confirm also that the names and ID number of the seller is exactly the same as it appears on his or her ID, otherwise, you may regret later.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must then do a search of records at the local lands office to confirm ownership and details that are on the title deed such as names of seller and identification number and also if there is any charge on the title, such as a bank loan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure you are satisfied with all the details as recorded at the land registry and on the title.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that the original title deed is available, NOT just a copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step will be to discuss the offer price, negotiate and agree on a fair price with the original true owner of the land. This is where your lawyer will come in to draw a legal agreement between you and the seller. \n",
    "\n",
    "This agreement will detail the identities of the seller and buyer, the sell price, mode and date of payment, size and location of the land and any other information necessary to complete the transaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to appear before the land board to get consent for transfer, depending on the land and location. You may send a representative such as the lawyer to represent you.\n",
    "\n",
    "After taking possession of the land, engage your surveyor to sub-divide the big portion into smaller sizes, preferably 1/8 (50 x 100). \n",
    "\n",
    "You will then aggressively advertise these portions for sale. It will be more profitable to sell them in these smaller sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 5 acre block of land in Lukenya area just off Mombasa Road behind Dayster University goes for between Sh.5 million and Sh.6.5 million as at March 2021. This is in Machakos\n",
    "County. \n",
    "\n",
    "A 5 acre block should produce more than 30 plots of 1/8 acre after taking care of feeder roads since each plot must have a road access. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a plot of 1/8 in the same area goes for between Sh.350,000 and Sh.400,000 depending on the accessibility and seller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combined lawyer and surveyor fees should not exceed Sh.60,000. You can do the math and decide for yourself whether it will be profitable or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also opt to go for 1 acre and divide into smaller plots. Other areas such as Kamulu, Isinya, Kiserian, Namanga or Machakos Junction are also good areas where you can get big chunks of land at fair prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advertising the plots for sale will be very important. You may need to print out brochures and distribute to potential buyers, you may engage brokers at a small fee, you can also advertise in the classified sections of daily newspapers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classified sites like like jiji.co.ke, pigiame.co.ke e.t.c and social media influencers can be used to help you advertise and sell the plots quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The faster you sell off the plots and get back your money the better for your business. Therefore put serious effort in ensuring that you sell off all the plots quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Location will determine the level of interest potential buyers will show. Most buyers want developed areas and with good accessibility, come rain or shine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be prepared to take potential buyers to your land to view for themselves and confirm whatever they want. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will transfer the title of each plot to the buyer after payment. You can offer installment payments to attract more buyers. Installment payments should attract a higher price though.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages of this business*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Profit margins can be very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The price of land will always appreciate even if you don’t get buyers immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Demand of land is at its highest in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Easy to start, you may not need an office.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages of this business*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Many con-men and con-women have infiltrated land business.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sometimes it may take long to get buyers for all the plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no doubt that land business all over Kenya is lucrative. Many simple businessmen and women have become millionaires in a very short time by buying and selling land. \n",
    "\n",
    "You too can make it to become a millionaire, although it is not a get rich quick scheme. You can’t be a millionaire overnight. \n",
    "\n",
    "What you need most is to carry out independent due diligence, involve professionals such as lawyers, surveyors etc. and you will increase your chances of succeeding.\n",

    "“I am thirty-two years old and have never been able to save. I have tried to work with a budget to control my spending so that I can save but it never works out. At the beginning of every year I have resolutions, make the sacrifice for a few months but then I eventually find something to spend the money on e.g. an emergency, household item etc. Please help.” Anne.\n",

    "This is one of the most common dilemmas people write to me. How to save? Many people want to save but they are unable to. \n",

    "\n",
    "*1. Identify what you will do with the saved money.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Even before you think about saving money, you have to identify your destination… what do you need to save money for? Why do you need to save money? How good will it be to get what you desire to save for?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the questions to answer because if you don`t know why you are running, you cannot run or you will be tired of running soon.\n",

    "\n",
    "*2. Build the attitude first, not the bank account.*\n",
    "\n",
    "I know you want to save money so that you may have a certain amount of money to buy certain things, but you see, cultivating a saving habit is like other habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have to start little (most especially when you earn very little income).\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on building the habit first.\n",

    "\n",
    "They lack a saving habit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving habit is like a giving habit. When you have Ksh.1,000 and you cannot give Ksh.50 to a friend in need, who told you that you will be able to give Ksh.100 when you have Ksh.10,000?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now even if your income is small, start cultivating a saving habit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don`t look at the amount you are keeping now. That`s not what is important. The number one important thing to look at is the habit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you are saving money regularly (no matter how small)\n",
    "\n",
    "What will happen is that, very soon, you will love keeping money so much that you will be addicted to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you get to this point, you don`t need anybody to inspire you to save more percentage of your income.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Get the picture of what you will have to do with the saved money.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you don`t know, let me tell you. Human being do things either to earn pleasure or to avoid pain. The only two reasons behind every of our action is either to get some pleasure or to avoid some pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do people buy cars with borrowed money even when it may be stupid to do so? Because they derive some pleasure driving a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few weeks ago, a female friend of mine told me, “I always buy things and immediately hate them”. She hates those things because she never needed them in the first place… she only bought them with the hope of deriving some pleasure in having them.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Now here is my point; If you can create a greater pleasure in your heart in association with what you will use the saved money for, you will be able to avoid spending money on things you don`t really need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes back, the woman in my life was telling me, “All the money you should have with you, you have invested it in your businesses. Now you are not having enough money”.\n",
    "\n",
    "She will be happy if I am having so much money I can spend now, but I am smarter than that. Most times I will invest the token I have, even when I know that will affect my daily living.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, how do I get courage to invest instead of spending?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I always imagine what it will mean for me to have enough money in the future. This imagination gives me pleasure (which is greater than what spending will give me)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the picture of what you want to do with the saved money gives you more pleasure than what you can get from spending your money now, you will naturally know how to save money.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Differentiate between wants and needs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "More than 50% of things we buy are wants… we don`t actually NEED them in the first place… we only want them because we see other people using or having them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you watch ladies so closely, you will see them looking at other ladies as they walk on the street. Right on their mind is communication like, “That top is beautiful on that lady, I should buy one like it”, “and this skirt is smart on this lady. It makes more men to look at her. I will buy one like it”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though these ladies have more beautiful clothes at home, you will still see them buying more… simply because they see those fashions or styles on other ladies. That`s satisfying your want, not need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some men will start planning for a new T.V just the day they see a new, fashionable T.V in their friend`s sitting room. They will feel like, “John has bought that television, it makes his sitting room more beautiful. I have to buy that T.V too”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advertising is another enemy we have. Whenever we read or listen to an advert, we instantly desire to get the pleasure the advert promises, so we start planning on how to spend our money on those things we see on the advert.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a good money saver, you have to make sure you ask yourself this question before deciding on whether to purchase something or not… do I actually need this thing? Can I live without this thing? What is the worst that will happen if I don`t buy this thing? Will it really hurt?\n",
    "\n",
    "*In Conclusion;*\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving is firstly done by consistently putting aside money. It is not a one off affair but rather a habit that is cultivated. If you earn money every month, then you should save every month. The consistency is key. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, savings are put aside in an account that is not used for day to day expenses. Never mix the two. The account you get paid into or use to withdraw every day money is not the savings account. Treat savings like a bill. When you get paid, remove it from your everyday account and transfer it somewhere else. This way you get to see it accumulate.\n",

    "Finally, don`t forget to join our training on Raising Business Capital. We only have 3 days remaining.\n",

This is an inflatable toy designed like a house that is blown up using a pump and children pay inside. When not inflated, it can be folded and carried around easily. With less than Sh.100,000 you can get a good bouncing castle to start\n",
    "with.\n",
    "\n",

    "but there are also rectangular ones. These should cost you about Sh.40,000 to Sh.60,000 each depending on the size. They are assembled and disassembled on site so carrying them around will be easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also have other play toys such as clowns, masks, balls, balloons, etc that the children can play with for a change. Since you may have several children showing up at the same time, a variety of play equipment may be necessary to keep them busy throughout since not all may have the time or even space to jump in the castles or trampolines at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Location*\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Success story of Daisy Neema*\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a fast food business in Kenya is a lucrative business idea. We started a fast food business to serve people who work in offices. We realized that most office workers do not have much time to go for lunch.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we decided to start delivering food to their offices. However, the business is highly competitive, and you need to be unique to succeed. This how to start a fast food business in Kenya from our experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conducted a Market Research*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to conduct market research before starting a food cafe business. Market research will help you identify market opportunities. You can conduct market research by talking to people already in the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to find out what has worked for them before and what hasn’t. Our market research entailed interviewing office workers. We would ask them where they get their lunch food from. This helped us to see an opportunity and start delivering food to their offices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attending business networking events will help you meet entrepreneurs with valuable information in the business. Excellent market research will help you identify your target customers, their food preferences. It will also help you identify the best business location.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Business Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider setting up your business in a place with a high number of foot-traffic. Places near institutions like colleges, busy market centers are ideal places to set up your business. For our case, we targeted areas with many offices, while our target customers were office workers. We established the business near a banking hall and this helped us tap on more customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Write a Fast Food Business Plan*\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a business is like going out on a journey to an unknown destination. A business plan serves as road map for your business. You will need a guide that will help you realize short and long term goals of your fast food business. Outline the startup costs, sources of startup capital, risks, strengths, revenue projections and weaknesses of your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our business plan helped us to prepare for risks and how we would win since there were other fast food businesses that were in existence. What helped us to win in the competition was our food delivery service to offices.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Register your Fast Food Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Business names are important for brand identity and recognition. A business name should be easy to remember and impressive. It should also tell what your business is about. As such, it is important to come up with an ideal business name. You can seek branding services from a professional to help you come up with a perfect brand name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon choosing a perfect name, you will need to register it so that no one else can use it. You can register your business name online through the eCitizen portal. Fill business registration forms and provide your national ID and KRA PIN for registration.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Acquire the Necessary Business Permits and Licenses*\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure to register your food cafe business will land you in trouble with the authorities. You can get a business permits from your County governments offices. You will need the following licenses and permits for your business. The following are licenses for food business in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. A single Business Permit*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can obtain a single business permit from the City Council. A single business permit goes for around Ksh.5,000 annually but it depends with the size of your business. A certificate should be ready within a week upon payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. A Food and Hygiene License*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to obtain a food safety certificate to ensure that food sold is safe for consumption. A health officer will come to inspect your business premises to ensure that the place is clean and safe for food preparation before they certify your business. You can start your business upon receipt of the certificate. You will also need a Food Handler’s certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Fire Safety Certificate*\n",
    "\n",
    "All businesses in Kenya must be Fire Safety Certified. Since your fast food business requires the use of fire when cooking, you need fire extinguishers to manage any fire mishaps. A fire inspector will visit your premise for inspection, and upon compliance, you will be certified and get a Fire Safety Certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cost of Starting a Fast Food Restaurant in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of starting a fast food business depends on your business size and the area of operation. Starting a fast food business in urban areas is expensive. It costed us Ksh.80,000 to start our food cafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with the following items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furniture\n",
    "Refrigerator\n",
    "Cooker\n",
    "Microwave\n",
    "Shelves\n",
    "Gas cylinders\n",
    "Utensils\n",
    "Blender\n",
    "Cooking stoves\n",
    "Jiko\n",
    "\n",
    "The major setback we faced when starting our food cafe was high prices of food commodities in Nairobi. We resorted to buying the commodities in rural areas and in large scale to cut down on cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also faced stiff competition from already established food restaurants where some office workers preferred to visit and spend their time. For us, we were mainly targeting food orders to make deliveries. With time, we were able to save enough money and start a restaurant where customers would visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What to Sell in a Fast Food Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of your business will determine what food you can sell. However, most fast food businesses sell foods like hot dogs, fried chicken, pizza, ice cream, kebab, chips, salads, hamburgers, cakes and soft drinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Develop a Marketing Strategy for Your Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing you need to do is to promote your business. You can decide to distribute pamphlets and brochures for marketing. Visit offices and let them know the services you are offering. You can land an order to supply food during break time and lunch time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start by offering free delivery services and giving discounts until your business is established. An excellent way to retain your customers and to keep new ones coming is to offer exceptional customer services.\n",
    "\n",

    "05/03/2022, 1:17 pm - +254 742 304047: *WANT TO BE A CHICKEN, EGGS MILLIONAIRE?*\n",
    "\n",
    "When Deputy President William Ruto declared that he makes a cool Sh1.5 million daily from 200,000 chickens that produce 150,000 eggs a day, money hungry Kenyans went drooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "But apparently, squeezing millions in profit out of chickens is not as easy as milking a big “air supply” government tender.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Beda Ogola, an Applied Statistics graduate and successful poultry farmer, who ventured into this trade after campus, says chicken farming is not as profitable as most Kenyans imagine.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Generally, the breakthrough in poultry farming is tricky. One has to swim slowly. I have managed to stay afloat because of diversifying to minimize risk, having a well-organized marketing plan and using the internet to access clients across Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania,” he states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ogola, 32, has four farms serving three different regions. His Joska farm produces the Kuroiler breed, while an outfit in Njiru produces a mixture of the Sasso breed, commercial layers and ornamental birds.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We have capacity to manage over 3,000 birds of different ages. Currently, my farm produces about 16 trays a day for Kuroiler and seven trays for the Sasso breed. I have other farms in Rongo, Migori County and Sondu, Kisumu County for Rainbow roaster breed and exotic ducks,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ogola makes growers feed and a bit of chick mash because he says accessing quality feeds is a challenge, especially for farmers engaged in large-scale production.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s not easy to make money because of high production costs. Feed costs keep on skyrocketing, especially for the best quality brands. Farmers can make good money from poultry if feed prices are reduced and substandard feeds and vaccines are dealt with by the authorities,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ogola is one of the farmers who keep Kenya’s estimated poultry population of 57 million birds, 47 million or 75 per cent of which are indigenous chicken, according to 2020 Kenya Livestock sub-sector NDC report. \n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers also keep chicken broilers, layers, breeding stock and other poultry species like ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons, ostriches, guinea fowls and quails. While indigenous chicken are mainly found in rural areas, broilers and layers are kept in urban areas. The commercial poultry sector produces over one million chicks per week, 14 per cent being layers and the rest being broilers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all, the poultry sector was worth an estimated Sh.43 billion in 2019, with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimating that Kenya’s chicken population will rise to 178 million by 2050. But not all those who venture into the poultry business will become millionaires because as Claudet Shipiti, a farm manager, says raising chicken is hard work.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The first thing a chicken farmer does in the morning is to collect dead birds and isolate the sick ones. One must also check ventilation often to avoid suffocation or build-up of ammonia gases and revisit the poultry houses day and night to check on the birds’welfare and timely feeding. Without good management, you can’t make it in poultry farming,” Shipiti says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noel Malanda, a large scale chicken farmer who rears both kienyeji and broiler chicken in Ikonyero, Kakamega County, underscores the need for thorough research before venturing into poultry farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Chicken farming is not for the faint-hearted because many variables keep fluctuating. At times, you can keep chicken for six months, eating into your profits, because there is no market. Many farmers are forced to deal with middlemen who end up benefiting the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You cannot only rely on what is in the books. You also need to benchmark with other farmers for hands-on experience. Adhering to vaccination schedules and ensuring quality feed for chicks is critical,” says Malanda.\n",
    "\n",
    "The poultry farmer adds that the influx of cheaper eggs from Uganda where production costs are lower compared to Kenya is a big challenge for farmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If you attempt to match their prices, you will make heavy losses. Here feeds consume 75 per cent of total production costs leaving the farmer with very little to take home,” says Malanda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Njambi Kimani, who hails from Kiambu, gets tickled when he hears Nairobians dreaming about the millions that can be made from poultry without doing proper research on what the business entails.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I tried chicken farming but failed spectacularly. I had started with 200 birds but after some time they started dying one after another. It was actually a worry because the supplied birds were of mixed age. \n",
    "\n",
    "“The mortality couldn’t stop immediately due to stress, transportation and also brooder to big housing. The challenge I encountered in this business was managing the birds with poor labour and the high cost of feeds,” says Kimani.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr Linet Akinyi, a veterinarian, advises those intending to venture into poultry farming to ensure that they keep the correct population of birds based on housing, maintain proper spacing and hygiene, provide the right feeds and deworm on schedule. Also, the higher the capital, the higher the returns, she says.  \n",
    "\n",
    "“When you invest good money in poultry farming, you will reap big because large scale farmers enjoy economies of scale and their production costs are lower. \n",
    "\n",
    "“The profit margin is also higher when you pump in more money because you are targeting a bigger and more reliable market,” Akinyi says, adding that what ails many small scale farmers is poor record keeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You must keep track of things like the last time you gave an injection. Most of the small scale farmers don’t bother, unlike large scale farmers who prioritize records because they have commercialized production. \n",
    "\n",
    "“This is why is it is rare to find opportunistic infections in large scale farms. Everything is done in order,” she says.\n",

    "\n",
    "“I have a new business idea but it's so simple that others would copy it easily. How can I ensure my business idea is not copied?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What if someone starts copying my Business idea?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What if copycats go faster than me?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I have interacted with many smart entrepreneurs who are scared of other people just catching wind of their idea. They don’t even want to disclose their business idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also true for me. The thought that what if a competitor starts copying our idea comes to my mind all the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having copycats is inevitable. When they can’t innovate, they copy. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a new business idea is executed successfully, other businesses naturally imitate and emerge. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Embrace them*\n",
    "\n",
    "As the saying goes, Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Any good company or business needs direct competitors!\n",
    "\n",
    "Copycats validate your business. Their existence indicates that there is money in the market you are trying to capture and is worth fighting for. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is why investors always ask ‘Who are your competitors?’\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have no competitors, smart people will always question if your business idea is profitable. You should ask these questions yourself as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other businesses copying your idea means another set of smart people building a product, and marketing it to generate a buzz around their product in the market. Thereby expanding the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "They will reach out to customers you might not have thought of yet and thus help you identify new potential customers. They will end up energizing the market and boosting awareness about the problem that your product or service is trying to solve. \n",
    "\n",
    "By doing so, your copycat becomes an extension of your marketing efforts for free!\n",
    "\n",
    "Any business genius will tell you that when you have others replicating your efforts, know that your product will resonate with a wider audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct competition is war, but it provides validity to your argument, creates awareness and removes the blind spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Learn from them*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your copycats might resemble you but they will never be you. \n",
    "\n",
    "They know nothing about the customer psyche and the struggles needed to get where you are. Welcome them and let them make their own mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The copycat will often explore and make the same mistakes that you did. While you have iteratively developed your business over time by learning what works and what doesn’t, the copycat will either get stuck making the same mistakes and die, or will make new ones that you ought to learn from. \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow every move they make. These moves will give you new ideas, challenge your assumptions and point to the shortcomings of your own product. Copycats will bring you insights into the market, existing customers, partners and other potential customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embrace them, learn from them, because they don’t hurt your business, instead they will help you grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Counter them.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Embracing copycats and learning from them is one thing, but never let them hurt your business in unscrupulous ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t let them steal your customers, don’t let them steal your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create High barriers to entry. Get copyrights & patents in key markets. Patent key components of your software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sign ‘Exclusives’ with key partners.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Buy domains and protect your trademark in key markets as early as possible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Have a large but clear vision on what you want the company to become. Keep executing on that path. If your vision is bigger into the feature, copycats won’t be able to catch up.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Keep innovating. Invest in R&D and build proprietary stuff that cannot easily be copied. Follow industry news to stay alert and updated about the happenings in the industry.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If it goes too far, consult a lawyer, send a ‘Cease and desist’ letter, and elevate to a lawsuit if necessary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Stick to your prices but offer discount/deals/annual plans to acquire new customers faster.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Talk to your existing customers more & understand their pain points. Make sure they understand that you are working hard to solve them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Research about the competitor key strength and weaknesses and hit them where it hurts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Take action as early as possible. Research weekly or monthly to get notified if a new company or business enters your competitors list.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever had your business Idea stolen? Have you ever had any copycats? What did you do about it? \n",
    "\n",
    "Did you panic or embraced it with confidence that you can stand your ground and perhaps even learn from them and go up?\n",
    "\n",
    "If your great business idea has low entry barriers, you can be sure that imitators will soon flock in, and you will be facing huge competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is so true in today’s business world. A typical scenario of companies competing with stolen ideas can be found in the software industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "A business idea should have strong barriers or differentiators to help ward off the competition. If yours isn’t too good in this regard, jettison it altogether, or think of ways to make it hard to duplicate.\n",

    "\n",
    "Looking back at how I got started in the business world, till today when I’m writing this, I can safely conclude that my entire business life is built on what I call “Other People’s Resources“.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today I hear so many people complaining of not having capital to start their own businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "I never had the resources either, but I learned how to get and use OPR (Other People’s Resources)\n",
    "\n",
    "At a point in my business career, I become so good at getting Other People’s Resources (OPR), so much that I raised 3 million from strangers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time I tell similar stories, I perceive some people don’t believe it’s possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s possible to start a business without having capital, all you have to do is to learn and master how to get Other People’s Resources (OPR)\n",
    "\n",
    "Either you need capital, partnership or even business ideas, you can get it from those who have it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It all starts by learning how to sell your ideas. You must be able to convince people that you know what you are doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "They must also be sure your business venture is having a great future. Plus, they must trust you.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have started businesses without my personal money. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are truly serious about starting your own business, nothing can stop you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply; learn how to sell.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can never be poor, if you know how to sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "And just before you think I’m talking about selling your products/services alone, I mean also your ideas, your philosophy, your movement, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have met people who called me on phone or sent me a message on WhatsApp complaining that they have business ideas but they cannot get capital to finance the ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know their problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have seen people who started movements but have no followers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know their problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are people who started businesses and failed and there are people who contested for elections and lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their problem is still the same; they don’t know how to sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "People want to buy your products/services, ideas, philosophy and even people would love to offer you capital to start your business but you must know how to sell or pitch them.\n",
    "\n",
    "People want to invest their money with you; but you must know how to (negotiate) sell your ideas to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "People are eager to follow you; but you must know how to sell your ideology and philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selling skills is the most important of all human skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take some time out to read some good books about negotiation, selling and marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take time to learn how to sell, you will create your desired life by selling your ideas to investors, employees and partners, by selling your products/services to customers and by selling your philosophy to the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend you read 'You Can Negotiate Anything' by Herb Cohen.\n",

    "\n",
    "I saw an opportunity in the business. But first, my husband was a forest officer. So when I thought of establishing the first nursery, I knew he would be there to guide me.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, just before I started, he passed on in 2013. Working at Kefri as a support staff where at some point my duty was to water tree seedlings in nursery beds, I decided to proceed with the project using the little knowledge I had gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started with a nursery bed of 20,000 tree seedlings, now I have 250,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Before starting the business, what should one consider?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing is to find out what type of trees are marketable in a given area. Then identify the ideal site for setting up a nursery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best place should be along the main road so that motorists and other road users can see the seedlings. Then it must be closer to a source of water because tree seedlings need constant watering unless there is rainfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tap water is not ideal for watering the seedlings because it is usually chlorinated; the chemical is not friendly to trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "One should also have a water storage tank, a generator to pump water into the tank, access to top soil and sand and organic manure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools to have include hoes, watering cans, wheelbarrow and rakes. Also, get quality seeds from recognized institutions like Kefri for better yields.\n",
    "Most importantly, the site must have a toilet or a latrine, a store and an office for keeping records.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What kind of tree seedlings do you grow?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have 30 different types of trees. But the ones with the highest demand are eucalyptus – E. grandis, E. urophylla and E. camaldulensis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Others that have demand include cypress (especially for fencing), casuarina and grevillea. People also buy fruit tree seedlings such as grafted mangoes, avocados and oranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I have introduced other species such as Moringa oleifera, Elgon teak and the Night tulip, among other indigenous species.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How has been the journey to produce the 1.5 million trees?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I started with a capital of Sh.250,000, which was part of my husband’s insurance compensation. By then, I used to pay people to fetch water from the nearby stream for watering the seedlings every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "On days such as Sunday, I used to go to the farm with my daughters to water the trees to save costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in 2016, I acquired a solar powered water pump and an overhead tank, which has really simplified my work.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the day, the machine pumps water to the tank, then from there we can use pipes to water the seedlings. This helped me increase the stock from 170,000 in 2015 to 250,000 at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, I employ three young men who help me in mixing soil with manure, planting the seeds into sleeves and watering the seedlings in the nursery.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is big market for the seedlings in around the country that one cannot satisfy. That’s why I am looking for a bigger space so that I double the size of my nursery.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much do you earn from this business?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from grafted trees, all other trees retail at Sh.10 per seedling. So if I sell what I have right now, I can get more than Sh.2 million which is the average income per rainy season.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has helped me take my children to school, where one of them has just finished her undergraduate degree and the other a diploma course. This is my main source of livelihood and I will plant trees until I retire.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Who do you sell to the trees?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have always relied on individual customers from counties in the region like Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega and Vihiga. People also come from Nyanza to buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people prefer this nursery because I have healthy seedlings throughout the year, now that I do not rely on rainfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The secret is that whenever I sell say 10,000 seedlings, I replace them immediately so that there is no gap. People also prefer my nursery because I have different varieties that are always ready for planting.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What are the challenges in the business?*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are pests one has to deal with like termites and crickets, which feed on the trees. But I keep on managing them using appropriate pesticides.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other challenge is that animals feed on the tree seedlings, especially if the nursery is not manned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ban on use of plastic bags has also come with its challenges. I have to transit to the eco-friendly packs but the thing is that I have to source them from Nairobi and other far towns.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally* \n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you have leant from this interview. There is more to starting this tree seedlings business than just the money. \n",
    "\n",
    "The future of this business looks bright. Remember, nothing good comes on a silver platter. Don’t just sit there, start small and dream big.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "While most of us may know the importance of opening a savings accounts, only a small number of people have these accounts and even fewer actually use them regularly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might be because the interest earned on these accounts is often zero and transaction costs (such as withdrawal fees, minimum balances, or the distance a client needs to travel to reach a branch) are also high.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the Kenyan government launched M-Akiba in 2017 to encourage people to save and earn high returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than being one of the most attractive savings product available to the average Kenyan, it also gives you access to a gold standard capital market financial product that was previously beyond the reach of many Kenyans. \n",

    "\n",
    "The money raised from the bond will be used for funding of government infrastructural development projects, both new and on-going. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the M-Akiba bond is also aimed at enhancing the savings and investment culture by Kenyans. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kenyan savings is at 11% of GDP while countries like Qatar are at 60%, while Rwanda and Uganda are at 22% each. \n",
    "\n",
    "*What are the benefits of investing in M-Akiba retail bond?*\n",

    "*What are some of the advantages of online freelance writing?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the largest audience that consumes written material is found online. Writing online has therefore given me a wider audience. Secondly, being a lifestyle blogger has exposed me to a large network of people in various industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have previously been contracted as a copywriter or a content creator by the government, an NGO and an events-organising company. Additionally, online freelance writing has an element of freedom to it. I am fully in charge of my schedule. I only take assignments that I am able to finish, and have time to engage in my hobbies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pay is also decent if you are consistent and have built a good clientele base. Most online writing jobs pay from Sh.2,000 for a 150-words piece of work. With a significant number of Kenyan graduates unable to get jobs, online writing jobs have become an attractive alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need is a laptop, a strong Internet connection and willingness to learn and grow. With the right freelancing sites, it is possible to make as much as Sh.100,000 in a week. Determination and patience are key in this job. Many may not consider online freelance writing a worthwhile job, but it is, it builds your resume, cultivates your discipline and work ethics and pays your bills just like a ‘regular’ job would.\n",

    "After graduating in 2010, Oketch got a job as a medical representative for a pharmaceutical company. It is his then roommate that introduced him to working online. While the remuneration at the company he worked for was modest, working online seemed more rewarding, and so he resigned to become an online freelance writer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In what three ways have you benefitted from your job?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, working as a writer is an intellectually rewarding experience since it involves lots of research on a wide array of subjects. Since I am often online, I keep abreast of current local and global occurrences. Financially speaking, I would describe myself as stable – I live in my own home and drive my own car.\n",
    "\n",
    "*From experience, what are some of the challenges of freelance online writing?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly all the tasks will require you to scour the web for information. In other instances, you have to watch several video clips before embarking on the work. A reliable Internet connection with a consistent bandwidth is therefore critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Internet bundles from mobile service providers is costly. I have found that home-based Internet connection is a more suitable alternative, though to bear in mind is the cost of installation and the monthly premiums one has to pay to stay connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the different time zones between clients and writers, you are forced to work odd hours, sometimes late into the night. You also risk having your account shut down if you perform poorly; this is more or less like retrenchment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also clients who do not pay for work done. Also, too much exposure to computer light is irritating to the eyes, and there is work burn-out, especially when you take on many assignments. I also have to mention that finding clients is becoming harder due to the growing number of companies that have come up to offer these services; stiff competition forces sites to lower fees charged for work in an effort to establish a niche and lure more clients, which consequently affects the writers’ pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Have Kenyan youth satisfactorily utilized the host of opportunities on the digital front, in your view?*\n",

Many graduates still hold the traditional viewpoint that 9am-5pm office jobs are more satisfying. Despite their knowledge of the immense digital opportunities, many would only utilize them as a side-engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The government recently launched the Ajira Digital Programme targeting youth interested in making a living online. How do you think the programme could be packaged to lure more young people?*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a worthy and timely initiative, but there is need for modifications for it to fully achieve its intended purpose. First, the timetable of online classes should be diversified to include evening classes to cater for students and interns who are unable to attend daytime classes. Secondly, the website needs to be more appealing and easier to navigate. Perhaps the government should advertise the programme more, because, surprisingly, eight months after it was rolled out, thousands of youths remain oblivious to its existence, role and benefits.\n",

    "\n",
    "I have registered as a writer on Upwork and iWriter. I have accounts with these two sites. This is where I find clients. Clients post their jobs, and writers bid for them. That said, some websites don’t require one to bid for a job. Jobs are posted and writers pick them up on the panel as soon as they are posted. Sometimes, clients specify who they want to perform the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A person just starting out may be frustrated since it may take long to get a job, which can be demoralising, so persistence is key. Usually after submitting your job to a client, they will rate you, so the more quality jobs you have completed, the higher your rating, hence the more the jobs you are likely to get.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Working from home can be distracting, how do you ensure that you meet deadlines?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks usually have a time limit. I refrain from anything else until I have completed the task at hand, lest the client withdraws the offer, or the job gets automatically cancelled. This means that I dedicate a number of hours bidding for the jobs and upon getting them, I settle down to work on them within the specified time. Most sites have a timer that starts ticking immediately the job is picked. This keeps you on your toes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Good communication skills are essential for a freelance writer as they are in any other profession. To transcribe, you must understand the language in question. For instance, I am proficient in the German language. Networking with other writers is also important – you learn about new stuff in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obediently following a client’s instructions and handling their work professionally helps to build trust with them; they may contract you for other tasks in future. You should also prepare for spells when there are no jobs.\n",

    "\n",
    "A researcher should deliver work in the language the client understands. Clients from non-English speaking countries for instance prefer easy-to-read and simple English.

    "\n",
    "Not so many Kenyans have realized how lucrative mushroom farming is yet. It is a pretty impressive investment only a handful of the informed farmers in Kenya are getting into. The demand for the delicious and healthy fungi is soaring, which means that the current supply does not come close to being at par with the demand. This is actually the strongest factor causing the high prices of mushrooms in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "During my research, I checked out for the current price of mushrooms at Zucchini Supermarket which was selling a Kilo of button mushroom for almost Ksh.1,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current prices are at an all-time high, simply because the mushroom market in Kenya is seriously undersupplied. So if you are looking for a side hustle that is probably going to pay more than your day job, mushroom farming is the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people ask why mushrooms are expensive, being a fungus. One of the reasons is that mushrooms, also known as the “fruit” of the fungi family, are rich in antioxidants, lean proteins and essential vitamins. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other reason is that mushroom farming is quite technical. The challenging manner of its growth, being that they don’t grow in soil, inhibits people from taking it on as a viable investment. This could be easily solved by a farmer getting the technical knowhow from the experts at Richfarm Kenya, 0724698357.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Investment and returns of mushroom farming in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial investment is on a basic minimum. Let us take oyster mushroom farming as an example, for this is the easiest variety to produce in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "With 1 square foot of space, they could easily produce 10kgs in a year’s time. With the current wholesale price of ksh.400 per kilo, one is expected to make Ksh.400,000 in turnover from a 10’ by 10’ space. \n",
    "\n",
    "A small space is needed for the mushroom growth. A garage will do just fine, and for those without one, a grass thatched mud house will do. \n",
    "\n",
    "All this talk may give you a notion that mushroom farming is a walk in the park that you would start now and boom! Reap the benefits tomorrow. This couldn’t be farther from the truth, since the investment could be quite bumpy. For example, the substrate needed ought to have been sterilized in the right conditions, failure to which, the seeds wither.\n",
    "\n",
    "After harvesting, mushrooms become highly perishable, one therefore needs a ready market post-harvest. The fresh mushrooms usually contain around 90% water content. Drying them has proven to preserve their nutrients and flavor hence one could invest in some drying equipment so as to extend their shelf-life.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mushroom Farming requires only a small space*\n",
    "\n",
    "Another fact that will excite you about mushroom farming is that you do not need several acres of land to make a good income. In Kenya, some farmers are actually turning their backyards and even garages into mushroom farms, and confess that they make way more than what they did from their large scale farming of other crops.\n",
    "\n",
    "But well, it’s not all easy money and overnight success as the foregoing statements might make it sound. To start a solid business in mushroom farming, one needs to invest in a number of things. Let’s take you through these things; \n",
    "\n",
    "*Mushroom Growing House Design and Requirements*\n",
    "\n",
    "So the first investment you need to make is building a mushroom growing house. It’s not really costly: in fact, all you need is a simple mud-house with a grass thatched roof. This can be done the very traditional way of using posts and sticks to build the wall structure then fill it up with mud or you can do it as we did using earthen bricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the house is complete, you need to make shelves. You can use wood and off-cuts since these are readily available and cheap materials. These shelves are used to hold the mushroom growing bags. Now that’s where the science starts- the bags!\n",
    "\n",
    "*You Can Prepare or Buy Ready Mushroom Growing Bags*\n",
    "\n",
    "Mushroom growing bags are simply plastic bags filled with a material called a substrate. The substrate is specially prepared. Basically, anything grown on land is a potential substrate for mushroom cultivation. \n",
    "\n",
    "One may use rice husks, dry banana leaves or coconut waste. Anything from the legume family, such as bean waste, is great because of the nitrogen content. Most commercial mushroom farmers in Kenya use hay, wheat straw or rice husks. Its preparation process is a bit detailed; I cannot cover it in this article but you can always reach experts at Richfarm Kenya, 0724698357 for help in that.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Where to Buy Spawns - The Mushroom Seeds*\n",
    "\n",
    "Next are the spawns, or the mushroom seeds. These seeds can only be bought from a professional propagator so as to be sure you get clean, non-contaminated material. On average, 1 kg of spawn will cost Ksh.600 and would be enough for approximately 40 standard size bags. \n",
    "\n",
    "These seeds are introduced in the bags filled with the substrate and all a farmer does from there on is simply maintain the recommended moisture levels in the bags and the growing house, and wait to start harvesting: no weeding, no spraying pesticides and fungicides and no working under a scorching sun!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Wholesale Mushroom Prices in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the crop’s lower cost of production and the high yielding capacity, mushrooms present a good opportunity for small to middle scale farmers. A kilo of mushroom retails at between Ksh.400 to Ksh.600. This high profit margin means that one will take a shorter time to break even and eventually make profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a total of fifteen different cultivated mushrooms varieties in the world. A farmer may need to know the various types in order to make the right decision when investing in this sector. The most common ones in Kenya are button and Oyster mushrooms. There are exotic mushrooms that can be grown, often for medicinal use, but they require more skills to grow and knowledge of the markets to find buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The best mushroom variety to grow in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "Button mushrooms are quite popular and readily available. The downside is that they are prone to diseases and infections. Oyster mushrooms on the other hand, are hardier and more resistant to infections. Besides, substrates for button mushrooms are prepared and cultured a month ahead. For oyster mushrooms, you can pasteurize your substrate today and introduce the spawns the following day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mushrooms are best when freshly picked, so most are sold to local consumers. After they are harvested, they are delivered to local chefs, food co-ops, grocery stores and directly to consumers at the local market.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mushroom Market in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many individual buyers of mushrooms in Nairobi and other big towns. Most of them buy in wholesale prices and resell the products to hotels or supermarkets. So we suggest that you carry out a market survey as you start your mushroom production. \n",
    "\n",
    "Visit the local vegetable market and talk to a few wholesalers whether they would be willing to buy the mushrooms from you, once they are harvested. Inquire on the price they would be willing to buy for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a social media presence, create a Facebook page and group, create a WhatsApp group and also have an Instagram and TikTok account for your farm. This will help you a great deal in marketing and showing the rest of the world about you mushroom venture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invest in good packages, since the packaging system, goes a long way in maintaining the mushrooms’ freshness. You should indicate the contact details as well as the farm’s location on the packaging material so as to attract future customers. Make sure to only package the good quality produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Place placards in the local vegetable shops and around your neighborhood. Ask your customers to spread a good word about your mushroom business to their family and friends. Make sure to always emphasize all the nutritional benefits of the mushrooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers’ market provides a great way for the farmers since they get to sell a large part of the harvest all at once. This is because market days attract large crowds, who are looking to buy from the locals. You only need to set up a booth and you are ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "On large scale farming, farmers should look for companies that are producing dietary supplements from plant extracts. As discussed earlier, mushrooms are great immune boosters. Email them on their respective websites with your information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now days, WhatsApp groups offer a reliable platform for marketing your produce. Create a whatsapp group with your neighbors and update them when the produce is ready for sale. Share delicious mushroom recipes so as to entice people into cooking the mushrooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Dos*\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Keep the growing environment clean and sterile always\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) It’s advisable to experiment with a small farm before venturing into a big farm\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Consult an agriculture extension officer in your area for further advice\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Seek mentorship from farmers who are already doing this to understand what challenges they face\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Explore your market options in advance to avoid last minute surprises and disappointments\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Don’ts*\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Don’t take shortcuts, mushrooms are very delicate crops and you can lose your entire investment if you don’t follow professional advice in handling them\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Don’t buy seeds (spawns) from cheaper sources, always buy from reputable sellers e.g. JKUAT\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Don’t forget that cleanliness is at the center of your farm’s productivity (again, and again)\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Don’t be in a rush, take your time, like in any other business mushrooms take time to establish\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Don’t stop learning, keep researching and keep enquiring to learn the best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1/8th farm will require Ksh.230,000 to establish from scratch. However, once the farm-house is constructed and the basic supplies are bought then the cost of operating subsequent farming seasons will drop to about Ksh.150,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "Button mushrooms take less than 14 weeks (2 months) to mature and a 1/8th acre farm with 1000 bags platforms can produce as much as 2 tonnes of produce. Each Kilogram goes for an average price of Ksh.600 and this can translate to as much as Ksh.1.2 Million in sales revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "Mushroom farming, although quite cumbersome and labor intensive, is actually very profitable. All you need to do is to put some effort in learning the best practices and combine that with the brilliant business strategies we teach you in our PROFITABLE BUSINESS IDEAS WhatsApp Group to launch the next big brand in the country. \n",

    "\n",
    "People nowadays like to spice up their weddings, graduations, political campaigns and even vacations with a limousine ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a craze that is taking over the middle-class segment of our society which, Kenyan economists predict will keep growing onwards to year 2030.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an investor’s point of view, limo hire business may look like the ultimate venture to undertake – but is there more than meets the eye? \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at the hustle and its intricacies.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Starting Limousine Hire Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major things required to run a successful limo hire business. That is (1) A fleet of limos (2) Good management (3) Good staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fleet of Limos*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not be in a position to cough out millions as a beginner, but that should not discourage you as there is a cheaper way of doing things. For instance, you can consider leasing – whereby you link up with an established Auto company and negotiate a deal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies like Mash Auto can offer you some of their limousines with as little as Ksh.10,000 per hour and you can in turn hire them out at Ksh.15,000 per hour. That way you get to reap a decent profit margin without necessarily investing heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "If leasing does not sound like a good idea to you, then you can take vehicle fabrication or soup-up route. For instance, you can get a used Toyota VX and get it converted into a limousine. This is done by cutting the vehicle into two pieces and stretching it out to mimic the features of limousines. The whole process will cost you about Ksh.5 Million per limo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and most expensive option is to import a ready-made limousine from abroad: brands like Lincoln, Chrysler and Cadillac are quite popular. A slightly used limo from any of these brands will cost you to the tune of Ksh.15 Million and a new one well over Ksh.20 Million.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Good Management*\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the sensitive & seasonal nature of limousine business, it is important to cultivate customer loyalty. Since not many people can afford to hire limos, you will require to invest in a good reputation so as to get some referrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, aside from good management, you will need to invest in good marketing practices. A functioning website, search engine optimization and excellent networking skills will definitely be a bonus.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Good Staff*\n",
    "\n",
    "Hire rude ex-matatu drivers and your business will go to the dogs. Look, we don’t have issues with matatu drivers but as much as you want to run a successful business, then you need to invest in good chauffeurs and service staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for people with training and experience in hospitality. Only hire people with a certificate of good conduct. Remember, limo transport is more than just transport – it’s a luxury and your customers will expect to be treated well.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Profitable Is Limousine Hire Business in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "On average a single limo can rake in a net profit of Ksh.3.5 Million per year. The business tends to be seasonal with months of April and December providing the best returns. What you need to do is price your services proportionately and indicate the minimum number of hours per hire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the price you charge should be based on the extent of luxuries packed within. An Audi Q7 with consumer delights such as a fridge, mini-bar, flatscreens and neon lights can go for as much as Ksh.35,000 per hour while a souped-up Toyota VX attracts as much as Ksh.15,000 per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "*To Invest Or Not To Invest?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Limo hire has its ups and downs. While there is good money to be made, you can only count on a loyal customer base to survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, most limo companies operate around Nairobi… it would be a good idea to focus on other upcountry towns like Nakuru, Eldoret and Kisumu as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the boundaries of Kenya, there are many untapped opportunities in Uganda and Rwanda. So – go ahead and invest. But do so with a good strategy!\n",

    "\n",
    "The retail business in Kenya provides a livelihood for thousands of people. To succeed in the shopkeeper business in Kenya, you need creativity and skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retail shops mostly sell general household items like sugar, rice, cooking oil, flour, snacks, etc. They thrive in towns and rural areas. There are many retail shopkeepers that have gained fame from the success of their businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "I previously met with Korir, a successful business man in Eldoret. Below is his business success story.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had been unemployed for close to 10 years after finishing my secondary education. I did not enroll in tertiary education since I was getting a few jobs as a casual laborer to dig people’s land.\n",
    "\n",
    "By then, my salary was more than enough since I did not have many needs. To till the land until 1 pm, I was paid Ksh.250 per day and I would work for six days a week. This translated to Ksh.1,500 per week and Ksh.6,000 per month. Therefore, I didn’t see the need to enroll in tertiary education.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How I Started My Retail shop*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting my shop, I had been unemployed for some years. The gardening work that had made me not enroll in tertiary education was not forthcoming. Things changed and my life lost meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started drinking a lot to beat stress and forget my situation. Most of the people we finished together in high school had finished their college education and some had good jobs. This made me hate myself and thought myself as a failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To stay busy and make a living, I thought of starting a retail shop. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to start one, but it was just a way to keep myself busy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, my parents supported me with startup capital. They rented a shop in Huruma Estate in the outskirts of Eldoret town. They also bought stock for my business and paid business license. All along, my parents were not happy with my drinking and wanted to find a way to keep me busy. I didn’t know that this would be my game changer.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doors, my business started performing better than I expected in the first month. This was attributed to the fact that prices for products in my shop were relatively lower than those in other retail shops. I must have set lower prices since I hadn’t spent a single coin to start the business. Although the prices were relatively lower, at least I was not selling products at a loss. This made many customers buy from my shop. The shop became too busy until I didn’t have time for drinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How My Retail Shop Grew to a Wholesale Supplier*\n",
    "\n",
    "After eight months of operating a retail shop, my business had grown significantly, making Ksh.35,000 profit every month. One thing that attributed to high profits for my business was that I could source products from direct suppliers at low prices. My father had introduced me to the suppliers. I saw this as an opportunity to start a wholesale distribution business.\n",
    "\n",
    "I borrowed a bank loan and bought a Toyota Hilux second hand for Ksh.1,200,000 for distributing goods. This is how I started my stock distribution business. However, I decided to retain my business. I decided to employ my sister in my business. She managed the business well and it kept on growing. I would supply stock to my shop, which increased our profits. The cost of operating my retail shop became cheaper, and I could pay my sister and still retain high profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, my retail shop and the wholesale distribution business generates over Ksh.150,000 a month. I am happy that my parents had seen potential in me and decided to help me open a shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "My encouragement to everyone is not to let their current situation deter them from achieving their dreams. Do not let your degree or lack of degree stop you from doing what you can do best. My businesses helped me to quit drinking and I have managed to build my life over the years. It is now three years in the business and exactly two years since I quit drinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Challenges I Face in My Retail Shop*\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge I was facing in my retail shop was the delayed delivery of stock by suppliers. This was a challenge when I started my retail shop, but it created an opportunity for me. I started supplying stock when I realized that other retailers were also facing a similar challenge. I now supply goods to my stock and my competitors’ shops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss of revenues, before hiring my sister to work in my retail shop, I had hired another lady and money was disappearing. Every time I did calculations of items sold and the money at the end of the day, they were not balancing. This made me fire her and employ my sister. I no longer face the same challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is a Retail Shop Business Profitable in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. With a good business location, you can make huge profits from a general shop. Business revenue from your shop is enough to pay retail shop expenses and give you a 30% profit. Getting cheaper suppliers will help you maximize profits. When setting prices for your products, ensure that they are not above those of your competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also boost your retail shop income buy starting an M-pesa business and Bank money agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a shop business in Kenya is a profitable venture. It is one of the ventures that employ a majority people in Kenya. To succeed in retail shop business in Kenya, make sure that you offer quality customer service and have a unique business from that of your competitors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nairobi’s eastern bypass is often interrupted at the roundabout to Windsor Golf & Country Club by a queue of vehicles on the roadside. The drivers are queuing to buy sugarcane. I joined them recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The young man, with the precision of a surgeon, peels off the hard part of the cane, then cuts it into small pieces and places these in a small polythene pouch, each going for Sh.20.\n",
    "\n",
    "The young man was quick to point out that the cane is from Kisii. I hear the same story when I buy sugarcane on Ngong Road. The market seems to have believed that the best sugarcane is from Kisii; this is good branding.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did a quick calculation and noted that one long piece of sugarcane could give him four pouches; that’s a cool Sh.80. The wheelbarrow had about 50 pieces of sugarcane, giving him Sh.4,000 per day. That translates to Sh.80,000 a month if he does not work over the weekend.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is sweet money anytime, anywhere. Selling sugarcane might appear “dirty” and unglamorous. But the money is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selling sugarcane and other small hustles like roasting maize or baking and selling KDF might seem small businesses, but the returns are not small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Curiously, the consumers of these roadside products are not themselves hustlers. This ensures a steady demand for the hustlers’ products. Their success is based on another factor, their apparent low price, just Sh.20 a pouch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the long run, such small hustles are very profitable. But we ignore them in world of business, preferring well established firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should be focusing on how to scale up such small businesses into multinationals. Suppose we can buy the same sugarcane in supermarkets just like muthokoi and githeri nowadays? Suppose it is branded?\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting small and scaling up such small businesses should be the focus of policy makers, academics and entrepreneurs. Through such small firms like sugarcane sellers, we can scale them up, brand such products and build a great business from such a small business.\n",

    "\n",
    "Local bars have become very popular in Kenya, especially in urban residential areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s almost a bar on every corner of the street.\n",
    "\n",
    "And more are yet coming up. Why do you think so? Well, the answer is simple. The bar business is profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, you must be curious and thinking, how do I get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, in this guide we take you through the process of starting your own bar local business in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "We list all the licenses involved in operating a legal bar in Kenya; we discuss the operations – challenges, survival, and trends to follow to make it in the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "And our hope is that by the time you finish reading this article, you will be ready to start your own successful business.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start a successful local bar, first, you need to;\n",
    "\n",
    "*a. Obtain Licenses.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Licenses of businesses with alcohol involved are guided by “Mututho Laws”, officially known as the Alcohol Drinks Act, 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each county has its own guidelines but these rules never stray too far from Mututho Laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "County governments have been in between a rock and a hard place when it comes to making regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While they may want to curb excessive consumption of alcohol to find a place in the moral scale, alcohol does bring its revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has led to so much corruption in the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bribery and having the county turn a blind eye on some of these businesses are not so uncommon.\n",
    "\n",
    "As dictated by law, here are the fees that are involved in running a local bar;\n",
    "\n",
    "*For premises situated within a city or municipality, the fee is Ksh.30,000 for 6 months and Ksh.50,000 for 1 year.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*For premises in urban areas that are not a city or a municipality, the fee is Ksh.18,000 for 6 months and Ksh.30,000 for a year.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*As for premises outside cities, municipalities, or urban areas, the fee is Ksh.9,000 for 6 months and Ksh.15,000 for a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other licenses needed to run a bar include;\n",
    "\n",
    "*County Single-Business Permit* - Every single business needs it and the price ranges from county to county.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Public Health License* - Budget for at least Ksh.6,000. Public Health officers issue it after inspecting the business and making sure it is fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Medical certificate* - This certificate involves individual workers. Every member of staff needs a medical certificate which goes for around Ksh.500.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fire clearance certificate* - This involves seeking advice in terms of protection against fire, installing the necessary equipment usually fire extinguishers, and paying for an inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Music Copyright of Kenya* - All establishments involving music need this. It is based on sitting capacity. For 25 people, you will need Ksh.2,331.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Performers Rights Society of Kenya* - It is a collective management organization licensed by the Kenya Copyright Board to represent performers in musical and dramatic works. Their main objective is to collect and distribute royalties to artists.\n",
    "\n",
    "*National Environment Management Agency* - It costs Ksh.3,000. It is used largely to ensure you don’t make too much noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "*b. Choose the Best Location.*\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to choosing the location for a bar, you should consider;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cost:* – By this, I refer to rent. For some, it’s easy because they may have land that they already own, but for most, it involves negotiating the rent price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be strategic.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Demographics:* – Bars in more populated urban areas tend to charge more. It is normal to do so since demand is more and the rent they pay is also more.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Style*: – Look at the style of the bar. Do you want a nyamchom zone with beer or do you want to style it to a certain mood? This will influence the neighborhood you want it in or the other way around.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Competition*: – In some populated areas bars thrive near each other, but for a local bar, the best advice is to place where there is minimal competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Accessibility*: – This should probably have been the first point. Your bar needs to be accessible if it’s local, somewhere many in the neighborhood can notice it. Most of the time bars are not placed within the neighborhood but at the periphery to avoid noise complaints and give the customers the level of privacy they deserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "*c. Capital – How Much Do You Need to Start a Local Bar Business?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The capital required for a bar is broken down into several parts;\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Licensing*: – As discussed above, location and size mainly influence the cost of licensing, though the difference it makes at the end of the day is not much.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Premises*: – This involves the cost of setting up a bar and the cost of having the bar in that location. Consider things like the rent of the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Equipment*: – This involves all you need, from chairs, utensils, music to the alcohol itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Operations*: – Operating the business will cost in terms of staff compensation, security, utilities like water and electricity etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*d. Operations – Managing a Local Bar Business to Profitability.* \n",
    "\n",
    "Operating a bar is very tricky. There’s a lot to look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s the music, the food, the service, the finances, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the energy of the room matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the mood is low, you have to find a way to lift it, otherwise, it could mean the beginning of the end for your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing when considering the operation of your bar is picking out the staff. The staff plays a big role in ensuring your bar meets the standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the bar manager to the cooks, the DJ, the waitresses, guards, and cleaners, the choice has to be meticulous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast and quality service is very attractive and it needs to be the priority of the manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing should also be considered. Every single word that gets out should be positive a word to attract people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of music, of course, doesn’t have to be yours. It just has to match the taste of the audience and the DJ should understand that.\n",
    "\n",
    "*e. Challenges Facing Local Bar Businesses in Kenya.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest factor that challenges bars is legislation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past 20 years, there have been so many changes to laws regarding drinking and bar ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, there was the regulation of noise. Bars operating in residential areas have to match these limits. The rule is less observed in areas outside Nairobi but the penalty is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there is the constant change in the taxation of drinks. There are always arguments on taxation in the country and most of the time that doesn’t work very well for bars as it always seems the best cause of action is to increase taxation on alcohol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, other advancements like Alcohol blow have worked to the benefit of local bars. People fear more, being caught driving under influence, so they prefer using local bars as they get to avoid highways.\n",
    "\n",
    "More factors that may lead to the fall of a local bar include low capital, poor location, poor service, poor operations, mismanagement, poor food, and poor music.\n",
    "\n",
    "If music and food are bad, it will fail because the alcohol is pretty much the same – regardless of the bar, you drink at.\n",
    "\n",
    "*f. Survival – How to Beat Competition in The Kenyan Bar Business Industry.*\n",
    "\n",
    "A challenge in starting a bar business today is that the number of bars has significantly increased, which makes it significantly easier for bars to shut down due to losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why starting a bar requires one to develop a careful strategy for survival in the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Realistic pricing will help you stay relevant in your bar business. Since it’s a local bar, you have to charge less than a high-end club.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pricing generally depends on competition, branding, value attached to your bar, demographics, and style.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, always strive to provide something different that matches your target customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep and follow trends too because bars are all about the “hype” sometimes and not the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*g. Business Trends for Local Bars in Kenya.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Estate bars now have larger capacities. Before, local bars could only accommodate around 10 to 15 people, but now, they do 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some local bars have even grown and established themselves enough to be considered clubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local bars have picked up on social media advertising to ensure they remain relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image portrayed on these media sites has to remain positive but catchy enough for it to become an attraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engage the existing customers by always showing them the experience that they could have at your bar is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even more important for relevance, bars are now organizing their own events — themed as either: karaoke or reggae nights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, they even invite artists to give mini-performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the events are as simple as celebrating existing holidays in simple but enjoyable ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conclusion.*\n",

    "\n",
    "Are you a football fan? If so, you need to capitalize on your passion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenyans love soccer. Not just Kenyans but Africans in general. We love the blues, gunners and so many others. We wish we could be present in some of these football matches, but as much as we like football, most people still cannot afford to subscribe to DSTV and watch the matches from the comfort of their homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only option is usually to go to bars. But there are a lot of people who don’t like going to bars either.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just imagine you own a football viewing center that has a sitting capacity of 500 and for each football match, your customers pay Ksh.30 to Ksh.50 per match. Multiply that 50 shillings by 500 and you will have a whopping Sh.25,000 per match. Multiply this by 3 since Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United games are the most likely to be full. What do you have? Ksh.75,000 on a weekend.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a month, you will have close to Ksh.300,000. The only costs are the DSTV subscription fees and the rent space which shouldn’t eat a lot in the estates as compared to town.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a business with huge potential yet people have ignored it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Look for Suitable Space for Your Football Viewing Center*\n",
    "\n",
    "The greatest challenge of setting up a football viewing center is space. Those who have the opportunity of space have an edge over others. If you have such a space, all you need is to set it up adequately, primarily to shelter match viewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Planks and trampoline are better options, depending on the number of viewers you anticipate. However, the viewing center must be adjustable or open enough to contain viewers. Trampoline serves this purpose because it could be adjusted whenever the need arises. For instance, the adjust helps you to roll down the curtains when it’s raining, or when you want people who did not pay not see what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, using planks to set the center up saves you the trouble of having to adjust when it’s raining, or making any of the changes due to weather. But you have to create enough windows and alternate doors. It will enable ventilation and relaxation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Wooden Bench:* Is a choice of seat that will last long, plastic chairs get broken easily. So make the benches long enough and provide fans (standing or ceiling) to enable a cooler atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gaming Center:* Best matches don’t come on daily basis. It will therefore augment your earning if you add a gaming station to your facility, where people will come and play PS games of their choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Blackboard:* It is another tool that you need; it will help you to advertise your viewing center; when you write match fixtures and their times, it helps fans not miss out on any, knowing exactly when it will kick off.\n",

    "*Get Good Televisions*\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step to take after acquiring a place and setting it up is to purchase TV set. Multiple TVs enable you to give viewers alternate matches. For instance, there could be three important matches at a go, and a crowd of fans divided according to their teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi TVs will serve every team supporting group their own match and will enable each one to see the matches wherever he is seated.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Buy DSTV Decoders Or Any Other*\n",
    "\n",
    "Dstv decoder is the most ideal in this kind of deal since it has TV right over popular league matches. Aljazeera sports offers reliable alternative but it seems to have been discontinued, find out. These two match providers are what you need to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get TV Subscription According to Your Need*\n",
    "\n",
    "Dstv has the TV right over most of the leagues:\n",
    "\n",
    "Champions league\n",
    "\n",
    "Spanish La liga\n",
    "\n",
    "English Premiership\n",
    "\n",
    "Italian Seria A\n",
    "\n",
    "French Ligue 1\n",
    "\n",
    "etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total subscription sum of the bouquet that covers all the league will cost you about Ksh.8,000 monthly or less, but it’s worth it. People always look for places where they could watch matches uninterruptedly, and that will result in them sticking with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Buy Standby Generator*\n",
    "\n",
    "One other way to make people stick with you is by providing alternative to power supply, in case the usual thing happens, (power failure) you will keep the match going uninterruptedly with your backup plans. UPS also helps to keep the TVs from going off while you are trying to restore power.\n",
    "\n",
    "*After getting all set up, make sure you follow these management tips;*\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Get a blackboard or notice board outside your football center to write out all upcoming matches for the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Have someone to maintain order. Football viewing can turn chaotic at times.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Treat your customers with respect. Customers are the backbone of every business! Be friendly to your customers. They are the sole reason you are still in business. Treat them with respect, and try to build personal relationships with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, if you are currently unemployed, you could try out this business. It doesn’t require much capital to start and it’s very easy to manage, if you know what you are doing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why is your business name so important?\n",
    " \n",
    "What is there in a business name by the way?\n",
    "\n",
    "William Shakespeare was an English poet and playwright, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world`s pre-eminent dramatist.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his book, Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare wrote, ’’What`s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet’’\n",
    "\n",
    "By this, William Shakespeare said, name doesn`t change anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you call rose by another name (i.e. daisy), it will still smell good anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to disagree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human beings are so weak that we judge books by its cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know, If you meet two ladies in a party who are equally beautiful, but one is called Daisy and the other is bearing an agly sounding name, before you know it, your heart starts preferring Daisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not because of anything rational, but for their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your business name is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I read on the internet that there are some “naming companies’’ who are charging above $50,000 to help you name and design your business` name, I knew why a name actually can be the difference between a business` success and failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "People use your business name to decide whether they will do business with you or not (just as a man could just decide to love Daisy instead of the other lady with an agly sounding name).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let me give you some tips about how to choose a good business name.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. What are you selling?*\n",
    "\n",
    "What is your product or service all about? \n",
    "\n",
    "Let your name reveal it in such a way that anyone who is seeing your name for the first time will have an idea of what your business is all about. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you first see our group name, PROFITABLE BUSINESS IDEAS, you are likely to have an idea that here we are posting business ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let your name reveal what your business is all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Make your business name easy to remember.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are doing business in Kenya and you are using a French name, you will spend a lot on marketing or your business will die.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your name is not generally pronounceable in your market, you are in trouble. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why? \n",
    "\n",
    "Because people will need to remember your name if they will have to patronize you or recommend your products to their friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Don`t choose a business name that your market already knows as evil.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you think common sense should tell everyone this? \n",
    "\n",
    "I will prove you wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "You see, even if there is a popular hilarious movie character, musician, footballer e.t.c, his name (if chosen for your business name) could affect your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "That`s why you may need a little research before choosing your name.\n",
    "\n",
    "If for instance you are having a medical business (hospital for example) and you name it, ‘’Romeo & Juliet hospital’’, how does that sound?\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhere about childish love, I guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "That name, I think, doesn`t connote seriousness expected from a hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do a little research to know if that name you are planning to choose has not been known with some ugliness, even in the next county to yours (because one day you might grow your business to that county)\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Don`t let your business name be too long.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the biggest companies` names, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook etc. why a very short name? \n",
    "\n",
    "For the reason I stated in the point 2 above … because you will need your customers to remember your business name … easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if your own name cannot be very short, then, it must be easy to remember or you will publicize its abbreviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "That`s what IBM did. That`s what MTN did.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because their names are long and forgettable, they adopted the abbreviation of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Don`t use your personal name.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your market is likely to respect an organization than individual, even if it`s a small business. Even if you are having a barbing saloon business, people are more likely to respect ‘’Neat Cut Saloon’’ than ‘’Mary Moraa Saloon’’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe the way these two names sound and you will understand what I’m saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another side to it is that your business will one day grow and get to a land where your name actually means nonsense.\n",
    "\n",
    "If for instance you are having a typical Kenyan name and name your business after yourself. One day your business may expand to South Africa, then you will start having problem with your market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone will ask me here, what about Dangote who used his name for his business?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your name can work for your business, even if it sounds like nonsense, but you will need a whole lot of money to promote your business (which i think you can avoid).\n",
    "\n",
    "More so, some name actually sound generic, like Dangote. It`s easier to call and remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Check your business name`s availability on the internet.*\n",
    "\n",
    "There is what we call domain availability (you can google that). We check through the internet to know maybe the name we have in mind has not been taken by another business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this is only useful for an online business, any successful business is eventually going to be online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you start small now, you are not planning to remain small, are you?\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be good to check that name and buy its domain name (if you can).\n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn`t mean that you must have a website now, though it`s nice if you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Check the availability of your intending business name with the government*\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, this is very easy and cheap. The last time I tried this in Kenya (at huduma center) I spent less than Ksh.1,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conclusion*\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we fight with our names in the business world?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not in business alone… everywhere in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know a very close lady friend who introduces herself as Lizy. But I heard her mum call her Elizabeth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Al Ries and Laura Ries wrote in their book, The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding that, the brand with a better name will come out on top. \n",

    "Business plan writing is a very important part of every business venture and that is why you hear about it very often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, most people who think about starting a business usually don`t consider writing a business plan.\n",

    "\n",
    "The power of business partnership is amazing. It’s a highly effective business model more African entrepreneurs should consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some years ago, I had a brilliant idea to develop a new food product that could be very successful if I could bring it to the market. It was one of those possessive ideas that made me lose sleep for days.\n",
    "\n",
    "I couldn’t sleep because I was excited and afraid. I was excited because I had stumbled on an amazing business idea, but I was also afraid because I wasn’t sure how to make the product and bring it to market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other more serious reason I was afraid was capital; I didn’t have enough capital and resources to transform this brilliant idea into a lucrative business.\n",
    "\n",
    "What could I do to make this dream come true?\n",
    "\n",
    "After considering several options, I finally decided to find a good business partner to work with me on the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, I am very happy to let you know that my business idea become a reality. In fact, I can totally admit that this business idea could have died and been forgotten if I didn’t find a good person to partner with.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will share with you five reasons why, in my experience, you need a business partner and later in PART 2 of this article, the things you must look out for before you partner with anyone in business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5 REASONS WHY YOU NEED A BUSINESS PARTNER*\n",
    "\n",
    "When entrepreneurs have brilliant business ideas, our natural instinct is to tell ourselves that we can do it alone. We want to become the hero, the ‘self-made’ successful entrepreneur.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we often do not realize is that the journey to success in the land of business can be tough, ruthless and very challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase your chance of survival and success, it’s often a great idea to find a good person to share this journey with you. I have had a couple of business partners and have gained some knowledge and experience in working with the right partners to get what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are my top five reasons why I think you need a business partner:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Access to more capital resources*\n",
    "\n",
    "Inadequate capital is a common threat that faces African entrepreneurs every day. It is also the single biggest reason why many people will never start a business in their lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although access to startup capital is a challenge for entrepreneurs across the world, I think it’s a much more serious problem in Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Banks make it difficult for small businesses to access loans, and finding investors to support a new business idea is often a wild goose chase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a bank that would ask for collateral and demand high interest rates, a business partner can contribute capital on far more favorable terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than get a bank loan (which would have been very difficult, if not impossible), I provided some of the capital while my business partner contributed the rest. As a result, we shared the risk of the business between ourselves, which is much better than one person bearing the full financial risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I didn’t have a partner to contribute some of the capital, it’s very likely that my brilliant business idea would still be locked up in my head by now. But by sharing my idea with the right person, I attracted the extra capital I needed to make the business take off!\n",
    "\n",
    "On a continent where access to capital is poor, African entrepreneurs can find the capital they need to make their business ideas come alive by joining capital with other people. Compared to other sources of capital (such as banks, investors etc.), business partnerships are an easy, convenient and low-risk source of startup capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Diversity of ideas, perspectives and opinions*\n",
    "\n",
    "“Two (good) heads are always better than one.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That was a common expression from one of my school teachers who always reminded me of the value of cooperating with other people and working together as a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "From my experience in business partnerships, my teacher’s statement is completely true. Two good heads are many times better than one!\n",
    "\n",
    "I know this because when I first discussed my idea with my business partner, it was like refining gold. We brainstormed, analyzed, debated and argued on different aspects of the business idea and how and why it would work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We both had different perspectives and opinions of the idea and this diversity helped us to make the idea better and stronger. It was a great experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know what ‘tunnel vision’ is? It’s a disability that affects entrepreneurs who come up with brilliant business ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tunnel vision is a close-minded way of thinking that makes you see only the favorable things you want to see. While this may sound good, it’s actually dangerous when you’re working with business ideas. What seems great and profitable may not turn out to be that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why you need another ‘eye’ who can objectively look at your business idea and bring to your attention those things you missed out or were too excited to think about. This is exactly what a good business partner will do for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of a diversity of ideas, perspectives and opinions shouldn’t stop at the ‘idea stage’ of your business. It will also help your business as it grows and encounters new challenges, problems and opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly one of the greatest gifts I enjoy from business partnerships. I have found that better decisions and solutions are made when two or more ‘good heads’ come together to do business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Do more with your time.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever been in two places at the same time?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, I’m not talking about horror movies or ghosts. I actually did it sometimes back.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had already fixed a doctor’s appointment when the technician who we were considering to build the machines for our new business called for an important meeting at the same time I was supposed to be with the doctor.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I was in this business alone, I would have had to suffer the inconvenience and pressure of losing one of these appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, my business partner took care of the technician while I kept my date with the doctor!\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, a business partnership allows you to do more things with your time and helps to reduce the pressure and stress of doing everything by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are not available to take care of business, it’s good to know that there’s somebody you can count on to cover for you. It works just like insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "My business partner got married sometimes back and on that same day, we had to supervise work at the farm site. Guess who made sure everything went well at the site? Me!\n",
    "\n",
    "I showed up early at the site, made sure everything went well and drove back just in time before the wedding reception started. The business did not suffer any delays because of the wedding. That’s one of the sweet benefits of business partnerships!\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Everyone needs some emotional support*\n",
    "\n",
    "The journey to success in business is usually full of highs and lows, ups and downs, wins and losses, successes and failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not strong enough to withstand the shocks and disasters that come with business, you may become discouraged and ultimately give up. While some entrepreneurs can withstand these shocks on their own, many of us need some measure of emotional support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we found the technician we were using to build the machines, we tried for several weeks to find one but failed. I remember one Saturday afternoon; we walked for several hours under the rain, looking for a technician who had skills and experience in building the machine we wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wet, sad and discouraged, this event made me to gradually lose faith in the business idea. I’m sure if I were in the business alone, my idea would have died a slow but certain death due to that frustrating experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, my business partner remained positive and kept the idea alive. After a few more weeks of searching, he finally found a good technician and I couldn’t be happier with the guy he found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our business moved many steps closer to reality because my partner provided emotional support and helped to keep hope alive. Who knows what could have happened if I stood alone after that discouraging Saturday event.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Access to a wider network of contacts*\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting up a business is about getting things done. Raising capital, finding a good office location, buying the right equipment and hiring employees are just a few of the important things on every entrepreneur’s mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t know where to look or find help, getting these things done can be very challenging and may be the difference between a business that successfully takes off and one that doesn’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody knows everything. That’s why it’s always good to interact and work with other people who may have answers to our problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "You never know, you may find a solution to your challenges through someone who knows someone. Like they say, it’s a small world we live in.\n",
    "\n",
    "While brainstorming on our business idea, we needed to get information on a company that produces a similar product to the one we were working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn’t know how to get this crucial piece of information and didn’t know anybody who could.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guess what?\n",
    "\n",
    "My partner made one phone call and after two minutes of conversation, he had fixed an appointment through one of his contacts to meet with somebody who works in the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could have costed me time, money and effort if I had to do it alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, a good business partner will give you access to a wider network beyond your own personal contacts. This can prove to be a huge and very valuable asset!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally,*\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an old phrase that goes “Two is better than one”. The same principle applies to early stage small businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the right partner in crime, and you will start to have fun working together to build something that is going to be great.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don`t miss out on PART 2 of this article, i will be telling you the things you must look out for before you partner with anyone in business.\n",

    "13/03/2022, 11:16 pm - +254 742 304047: *PART 2: THE POWER OF BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP – How Can You Identify A Good Partner?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t be fooled, not all business partnerships work out well. Many businesses have crashed because the entrepreneur worked with the wrong partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, many people who have suffered these bitter breakups will often warn others to keep away from business partnerships. \n",
    "\n",
    "I can’t say they’re wrong. After all, partnerships are like a burning fire, if you don’t choose and use it wisely, it could burn you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, here are a few features every good business partner must have. These features will guide you to find the right business partner to work with you:\n",
    "\n",
    "*#1. He/She should share the same goals and values with you*\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everyone has the spirit and gift of entrepreneurship. Not everyone dreams of leaving their day job one day to focus on their own business.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s no point joining forces with a partner who doesn’t take the business as seriously as you do. If a person does not share similar dreams, passions and goals about the business, there’s a high chance the business partnership would never work.\n",
    "\n",
    "If they are not as dedicated and committed to the business like you, you may end up doing all the work. They will be a deadweight on your business and may become a negative force that works against you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need partner(s) who are motivated and ready to passionately work on the business with you under every condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "*#2. He/She must bring something valuable to the table*\n",
    "\n",
    "Business is not a hobby; it’s a serious endeavor. Don’t bring anybody on board as a partner because she’s a close friend or member of your family. You will be looking for trouble if you base a business partnership on sentiments instead of skills, knowledge and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good business partner always contributes something that adds value to the business. It could be technical or business skills, capital, connections, time and effort, equipment etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom-line is to ensure he/she brings something valuable to the table!\n",
    "\n",
    "*#3. You must be compatible with each other*\n",
    "\n",
    "A business partnership is a relationship between two or more people. And in every human relationship, the personalities of the persons involved are very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should partner with somebody you feel comfortable with; you just have to get along with your partner(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel intimidated, silenced or frustrated by his/her personality, it could be a warning sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all partnerships, there are times of argument and disagreement. It’s in your best interest to work with a partner who is willing to listen and consider your own views and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business partnerships are a ‘give-and-take’ relationship. Stubborn egos, on one extreme, and total submissiveness on the other, can be counterproductive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in a marriage – age, gender, race and religion don’t matter as long as the parties involved are compatible and understand each other well. \n",
    "\n",
    "*#4. You both must align your expectations from the business*\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the common reasons why some business partnerships don’t work is because the parties involved have different expectations from the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the beginning of the partnership, it should be clear what each person would own, do and get from the business. Most people skip this important step because they think it’s not important or are just uncomfortable with it. Don’t make this terrible mistake!\n",
    "\n",
    "You could have a Partnership Agreement or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that clearly spells out the terms of the partnership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do your best to make this as detailed as possible. When everyone knows what to expect from the business, there is less likelihood for suspicion, conflict or blame later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have seen sour business partnerships that ruined lifelong friendships and relationships because one party had different expectations from the business which they ‘assumed’ was shared by everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid the risk of assumptions by making everything clear beforehand. It may be uncomfortable at first but it always helps!\n",
    "\n",
    "*#5. Find Out The Gaps In Your Skills and Background*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you have a degree and have spent several years practicing as an accountant, but you have an idea of launching the next great app. It’s probably time to find someone who has a background in app development to help you handle the technical part of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you a great product designer, but you have never thought about how to achieve rapid customer growth for your business? Try and find a co-founder that is a genius in marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of thinking about this is to understand which job functions you would like to be responsible for in the company – and then identify which functions you would like your partner to fulfill.\n",
    "\n",
    "*#6. Think Beyond Your List Of Friends, Tap Into Your Networks*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a rough idea about what you are looking for, if you are lucky to live in an area with a large entrepreneurship ecosystem (like Nairobi) you can start to explore out there and meet people that qualify on paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to events, attend lots of conferences and put yourself out there – by doing this you will meet all kinds of people, which only increases your likelihood of finding the right person.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also reach out to potential co-founders through your existing networks e.g. through your alma mater or your current company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, don’t ignore your close friends and family – but if you choose to take this option, do not enter into the relationship lightly. Many “experts” out there will advise you that this is a bad idea, but in our experience, if done careful and in a transparent way, it’s possible to find a perfect co-founder among your close circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t trust someone intuitively, don’t enter into a long-term business relationship with them. Think LONG-TERM and remember that if all goes well, you will be managing a pretty large team together. Make sure your personalities complement each other and can provide a variety of perspectives as you grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a visionary who prefers to provide big-picture direction, find someone who can execute around the details and so forth. Make sure he or she can acknowledge and laugh at mistakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The worst kind of business partnerships are ones which someone isn’t willing to own up to their own errors, and can’t see the humor in the many bumps in the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above all, look for someone who is willing to get in the weeds and do the dirty work alongside you. You don’t want to be the only one hustling.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I conclude, I would like to invite you to join our training on Business Plan Writing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mobile phones have become essential in our everyday life. Mobile phones are used to communicate, send, receive money and learning purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "They have also created opportunities for people who repair them. Many people have bought mobile phones and from time to time, they break down. This has led to an increase in demand for mobile repair services in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "I met with Bolton Majale, who owns Boltech phone repair company, and here is his story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bolton Majale has had an interest in taking electronic gizmos apart and repairing them since his days as a student at Kisumu Technical College. \n",
    "\n",
    "So when he got a job with a leading smartphone dealer in Nairobi on completing his electrical engineering diploma, it was a dream come true.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, two years later, his dreams took a different turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I was a phone repair technician and would sympathise with clients whenever they were told their phones were beyond repair by my employer,” Mr Majale, 29, said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The truth was that some of those phones could be repaired, but the dealer wanted to sell more gadgets.”\n",
    "\n",
    "He slowly began to see these clients as a potential market for a business idea he had been thinking about starting.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I used to compare the small salary I was getting with what my employer was earning, and realised I would never be financially independent at the rate I was going. I wanted to establish my own service centre.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Service centres at the time gave priority to phones on warranty, Majale said, which meant that those whose warranties had expired had to pay for repairs, or buy new devices. This is where the enterprising young man saw an opportunity, and he registered his company, Boltech Ltd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though he was sold on the idea of going solo, it was not easy; it got to the point he even missed the small monthly salary he used to get.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I didn’t have any capital besides Sh.40,000 that I had borrowed from a friend. The first three months were so terrible that I couldn’t sustain basic business costs like rent, which was Sh.10,000. I eventually had to quit and go back to employment,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting clients was also not as easy as he thought it would be as he had yet to build a reputation; the line of business he was getting into relies mainly on referrals, not walk-in customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I worked for three months and then quit again. I borrowed another Sh.40,000 from several friends and rented an office on Moi Avenue,” Majale said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I paid the rent for two months and a three-month deposit in advance, but the landlord was auctioned, which forced me out after a month.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Not one to give up easily, he moved to another office along Taveta Road, but clients with smartphones found the location off-putting as it was along a somewhat insecure section of Nairobi’s River Road area. Still, he was able to save some money from the clients he did get.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make his business easier to find and more appealing, he moved once more. This time to Kenya Cinema. Within no time, business was booming for Boltech, and Majale hired five technicians to keep up with demand. He charges between Sh.500 and Sh.20,000 for repairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We built our reputation by repairing phones within 40 minutes to eight hours,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "This turnaround time was informed by the growing number of people addicted to their devices who could not stand the idea of leaving them at a service centre for days.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Phone dealers are very reluctant to direct clients to private repair centres like ours because they fear it might make their clients think we are more competent,” he said. “However, if they are willing, I would like to create a working relationship with them.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Boltech’s client base has since expanded to the counties, with the company receiving phones from other regions through courier services. Majale also offers pick-and-drop services to save clients the hustle of finding parking in Nairobi’s business district.\n",
    "\n",
    "“My vision in the near future is to have service centres across the 47 counties, with trained technicians from these regions,” he said. “I would like to work with county governments to train local youth.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Majale has opened a training college, where he charges Sh.25,000 in fees per trimester, with each course taking a minimum one year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the challenges Boltech still grapples with include lack of trust from customers, failure to pay for services rendered and competition from multinational brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "“My ambition is to be the biggest service centre in the region, recognised by all major brands as their first stop to service their customers’ devices,” Majale said.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have been wondering if a mobile repair is a good business, it is worth trying.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can take you about 30 minutes for a minor repair, while a major repair can take up to 2 hours. It means that you can repair at least 5 mobile phones in a single day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Revenues depends on customer's traffic to your business. If you have many customers, it is possible to make Ksh.5,000 every day from mobile repair business.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I conclude this article, I would like to invite you to join our training on Business Plan Writing.\n",

    "14/03/2022, 6:27 pm - +254 701 711058: *START A SELF DEFENSE TRAINING BUSINESS*\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately with the increase of violence going on, the need to be able to defend yourself or someone else is becoming more and more necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Personal and gender based violence has created a need for extra awareness and knowledge of how to deal with these problems and what procedures to put in place to prevent these things from happening. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has led to a demand for effective self-defense training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Offering a self-defense course means that clients will come to you to learn the simple, effective self-defense techniques that really work, without the expense and long-term commitment of learning a martial art.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of starting your own self-defense course business depends on whether you provide your own venue for the courses, hire space in an existing venue (such as a gym), or provide courses at the client’s premises. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that in the initial start-up phase of your business you look at renting space at a local gym, and offering classes at the client’s premises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working from home will require that you have a personal computer, cell phone and other home office essentials such as a printer. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you shop around you could purchase this equipment for less than Ksh.25,000. You will also need to factor in costs for liability insurance and a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Target Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "With the amount of violence in today’s society, there is no shortage of clients willing to pay for self-defense courses. It is just a matter of getting your business known. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest part of this business is finding clients and this is pretty much like any other online or brick and mortar business when it comes to getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "As businesses will form a large part of your potential clientele, you are going to want to create and maintain a website that looks as professional as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also want a listing in the Yellow Pages and it may be a good idea to join local networking groups to help you in spreading the word about your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have brochures made with details of your service, then call businesses, organizations and institutions in your area to schedule a self-defense demonstration with the owners and their staff members. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hand out your brochures at these demonstrations and keep a detailed list of all businesses, organizations and institutions you have approached in order to follow up with them at a later stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because word of mouth is effective in local markets, ask for referrals to other businesses from those that utilize your services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also consider approaching gyms and schools in your area and offering your services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make arrangements with school administrations to visit local schools and provide a show and tell session on self-defense. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here you can demonstrate to the children what self-defense is all about. Concentrating on discipline, self-respect and self-control you will have the opportunity to work with the children for approximately one hour in a classroom setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other marketing activities include handing out fliers, business cards, and advertisements at local shopping centers, malls, and grocery stores in your area.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Income Potential*\n",
    "\n",
    "Decide how much you will charge for your classes and lessons. Look at the local competition and on the Web for self-defense courses in similar areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to structure your fees: per session, multi-session packages, monthly memberships, corporate, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may also have design beginning, intermediate and advance classes – and charge different fees depending on the level of training required. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that many people associate price with quality; your clients may value your services more if you charge the same or more than the competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you develop your schedule and fees, consider that time and convenience may be more important to your clients than price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, set a preliminary schedule of how many classes per week will be offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, estimate the average class size. This is the most difficult part to predict, so just make your best guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "From your fees, class schedule and attendance estimate, you can project your revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Training*\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to be a black-belt in a martial arts discipline to successfully operate a business in self-defense classes, though a certification in martial arts is helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the systems that will best prepare you for teaching self-defense are the various forms of Karate, Taekwondo, Jujitsu, Aikido, Savatte, Thai Kickboxing, or another of the more than 2,000 fighting forms which exist across the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a self-defense instructor you will be running your own business and making your own hours. You will be working when you want — at your own pace. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your certification makes all this possible because you will have a valuable skill people will be willing to pay for. And that’s because you will hold the “key” to making huge impacts on their lives—helping them to protect themselves and their loved ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should establish a curriculum for the techniques needed to confront nearly every hostile personal situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "These should include breaking holds, quick counters to aggression, quick disabling techniques, using ordinary items as weapons, areas vulnerable to attack as a defense, how to counter yourself against weapons, and fight-or-flight decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the physical activity involved in the training, it is a good idea to equip every student with a Gi – a martial arts uniform made from heavy canvas held at the waist with an Obi – a white, heavy cotton belt tied in a square knot.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as karate uniforms, training tools should include rubber knives, rubber clubs and guns, and other soft imitation weaponry. These will facilitate the training much more than merely pretending the items exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to establish a connection with a wholesaler of martial arts equipment and uniforms, as this could be a profit center for your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your self-defense classes can be held in a wide variety of arenas from a garage or a gymnasium to an empty room at a local school. \n",
    "\n",
    "All that is necessary is a clear area for movement the size of which should be determined by the number of students in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most self-defense courses are conducted as a side business by their operators, and classes are often held in the evening and at weekends. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these are also operated adjacent to another business such as fitness centers, churches and schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the larger and more successful self-defense businesses are ’stand-alone’ operations with their own buildings, and classes are held at all times of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a great Idea that you can start and make a living in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "At my local village, at around 4pm to 7pm, you will find small groups of people (mostly middle aged men) along the road, market places or at homes chatting about village, county and national politics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good way of socializing, but have you ever asked yourself why most people are poor in your local village?\n",
    "\n",
    "One major reason why most people are poor (and would die poor) is because they don’t mind their own businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are over-concern about national issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "They think bad government is the reason why they are poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let Kenya`s president and politicians be whatever they wants to be. My life is in my hand, and my Creator.\n",
    "\n",
    "What exactly am I teaching here?\n",
    "\n",
    "The surest way to be poor forever is to hope the government does better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next to that is to hope that job (even good ones) would make you rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "By now you and I know better.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask, “But starting a business and making it successful is NOT easy”\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it is not easy and it would never be easy!\n",
    "\n",
    "I spent more than 6 years in the wilderness and desert of the business world, trying, failing, making mistakes, facing rejections and oppositions from friends and family members,\n",
    "\n",
    "So I understand when you say that it’s not easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you see, it’s better to die young as a free man, than to live long in slavery!\n",
    "\n",
    "That is how I always think.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was one of the best students to ever go to school. I was the best students in Accounting, Economics and Commerce. I graduated from University of Nairobi, School of Business with 1st class, an academic champion and an influential University political leader.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, with my good grades I decided to venture into business instead of trying my best to climb the corporate employment ladder.\n",
    " \n",
    "I have only worked for someone just about 17 months of my life (and that was the worst period of my adult life, you know but it gave me experience).\n",
    "\n",
    "It was not because I was born by a rich father or because I had anyone to finance my business ventures (in fact, my family opposed my going into business), but because I was willing to DIE, rather than be a slave in the corporate world.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have power to change your life, if you think you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need any government to make you rich, if you think you don’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t have to remain in the slavery of job you don’t like. You can start that business and make enough money to live your life.\n",

    "\n",
    "Well, I am here to tell you that all those opinions are not valid. \n",

    "\n",
    "The world we live in is becoming busier and expensive and the need for couples and even single parents to go out there to look for money to keep the body and soul together is increasing daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until recent times in most homes, it was only the husbands that went out to work, while the wives remained at home to take care of their children and manage day to day operations in the home.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is no longer so, because the income that an average man generates is no longer enough to foot the bills of the family. There is the need to contend with the continuous increase of house rent, school fees, food stuff, and transportation that might no longer be accommodated in just a single pay check, hence the need for the women folks to join the battle in searching for jobs to help support the family.\n",
    "\n",
    "This singular act of joining the working class could make a lot of things suffer; hence the need for a maid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, starting a business is all about solving a need in the society, putting together a maid service business is one venture that would continue to help alleviate stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have always thought of dabbling into this kind of business; here are steps that could guide you towards starting and managing your maid service business:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Register Your Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people who run this kind of business don’t even bother going all the way to register it. However, you must know that ‘what is worth doing is worth doing well.’ It’s advisable that you start with the right steps and get your business registered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact remains that the stress and cost of registering businesses in Kenya has gone down drastically. In case you didn’t know, people find it convenient and comfortable doing business with a registered business than an unregistered one.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Conduct Your Research*\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of what is expected of you to start your maid service business, you will be required to carry out a research that would reveal to you the qualities and characteristics of maids that are in high demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is so that you can be well guided when recruiting maids. Your research would also enable you to know where to get maids and how to locate those in need of their services.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Recruit Maids*\n",
    "\n",
    "When recruiting maids, it is very important that you aren’t tempted to recruit under aged ones. It could be cheaper and easier, but you might get jailed for breaking the laws that protects the under aged, as well as laws preventing them to be used for cheap labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you recruit maids that can read and write, are neat, matured and willing to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Screen Your Maids*\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that you would be assigning your maids to different houses where they might most likely live in, means that they must be trustworthy people. Detailed screening is one part of your recruitment process that you must pay huge attention to, so as to avoid law suits and to continue to be in business.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you recruit one wrong maid, you might ruin your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "So part of your screening criteria might be: medical and health status, criminal records, age, ability to carry out home chores, ability to read and write, just to mention a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you carry out a proper screening, you can avoid employing people with infectious diseases, criminals and lazy people.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Market Your Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Although some businesses require less aggressive marketing skills, some might require that you are always on the go to get new clients. Running a maid service business requires that you go out of your way to get more homes to service.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also want to do the word of mouth approach, by walking up to anybody you come across in these areas to market your services to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research also has it that one of the best ways to get new clients for maid service business is via referrals for your existing clients. If you do your homework very well and your maids perform very well, you would get satisfied clients talking of your services to other clients that might be in need of maids.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Get Feedbacks and Review Performance*\n",
    "\n",
    "From statistics, the percentage of clients who complain to those who don’t when offered poor services are almost 40:60. The possibility of your clients complaining when they aren’t satisfied with the services they are getting from the maid you assigned to them is high. \n",
    "\n",
    "When such clients aren’t satisfied, chances of them referring their friends to you will be low.\n",
    "\n",
    "To operate a top notch Maid Service business, you must go around the houses where your maids are serving to get honest feedbacks from your customers and also from your maids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! It is imperative to get feedbacks from your maids because in some cases especially in Africa, maids are often maltreated and molested. When things turn that bad; you could even get arrested if anything happens to a maid.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you get feedbacks and you review appropriately, you get informed on the best decision to take. In some cases you may have to re-assign some maids.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Sort out Payments Arrangement*\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the maids that are employed by your agency on behalf of your clients won’t be resuming in your office, it is important to sort out their mode of payments and how you can get paid by your clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best approach is to ensure that all the maids under your umbrella open a bank account or have a mobile money account like Mpesa and you agree on a fixed date when their accounts must be credited.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also ensure that your clients pay into your account at an agreed date. For instance; you could agree on the 3rd of every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not forget to deduct your commission and service charges from their salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "The way and manner you run your own Maid service business will determine how successful you can become.\n",
    "\n",
    "The market for this kind of business will keep growing up as long as couples find themselves doing 9-5 jobs or even run businesses that take them away from their homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business idea is still a soft target in Kenya that you can take on provided you are willing to put a little more effort than everyone else. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, nothing good comes on a silver platter. Start small and dream big.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Business Plan Writing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Everyone has a business idea that if provided with adequate capital, and everything else they require, they will be well on their path to entrepreneurship.\n",
    " \n",
    "However, there is a big difference between having an idea and executing the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "A business idea may sound easy and straightforward but most new entrepreneurs are hit with a rude shock of how tough it is to get a business up and running.\n",
    " \n",
    "Here are six common mistakes new entrepreneurs make and tips on how to avoid them.\n",
    " \n",
    "*1. The ‘I can do it all attitude’*\n",
    "\n",
    "A new business idea is like a baby to most people. We cuddle it, stroke it and protect it from anyone who shows up to critic your idea or any one who wants to give you a list of reasons why your idea won’t work or even explain vividly how it will be impossible for you to implement the idea.\n",
    " \n",
    "These often makes new entrepreneurs shy away from sharing their ideas and involving other people in the potential business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feeling of, “Since I came up with the idea, I am best placed to implement it and make it come out exactly how I want it,” takes over more often due to pride or fear that bringing in and listening to others will corrupt your original idea.\n",
    " \n",
    "However, instead of helping, this might slow down your implementation or result in you getting stuck along the way.\n",
    " \n",
    "*TIP* – As much as it is not advisable to listen to everyone’s opinion about your business, it is important to seek a mentor preferably one who is successful in the same business you want to venture into.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential customers are also key as they are the ones who will make or break your business, reach them through a market research strategy such as questionnaires to find out how your product will be embraced in the market.\n",
    " \n",
    "All in all, listen selectively sieving out useful suggestions from those that won’t help the business.\n",
    " \n",
    "*2. Focusing more on the idea and not the execution*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every business startup starts with an idea. Ideas are great, but your potential customers will not buy an idea neither will investors put their money in an idea that doesn’t have an executable solution.\n",
    " \n",
    "Most new entrepreneurs get stuck at the idea stage. They spend months talking about how great their ideas are, how it’s going to make them lots of money and change their lives forever but they never really take the first step of execution.\n",
    " \n",
    "*TIP* – Do you have that genius business idea you have been sitting on? It’s time to begin drafting an execution plan.\n",
    " \n",
    "To start you off, ensure you have a business model with a clear value proposition based on current market dynamics, an innovation that does not necessarily have to be new but should have a unique solution compared to what is currently in the market and a growth model that guarantees a great profit margin in order to attract investors.\n",
    " \n",
    "When you have these, take your first step, whether it’s designing your new website or setting up that first pitch meeting with your first potential investor.\n",
    " \n",
    "*3. Being short sighted with your first profit*\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the amount of work and commitment you place in your start up in the initial stages, your business might reward you with a huge profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the decisions you make at this stage are crucial for the long term success of your business. As much as you are justified to treat yourself as a business owner at this stage, making financial choices such as taking a fully paid vacation to Zanzibar or buying your dream car could prove costly for your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*TIP* – Growing a business requires setting short term and long term goals. Both goals should help you achieve your overall vision for your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips on how to use your first profit wisely are;\n",
    "\n",
    "• Re-invest back into your business based on your strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Invest in marketing strategies both traditional methods and digital methods based on your target audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Invest in a more qualified workforce in order to have a productive team.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Investing in yourself by taking more business courses and learning new skills that will better your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Dwelling too much on failure*\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to turning your business idea into a startup, it’s not a matter of if failure will happen but when.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure is inevitable, whether it’s making a wrong business move that suddenly makes you bankrupt, hiring a rogue contractor that ends up damaging your systems or your business partner walking out on you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever it is, it is bound to happen sooner or later and dwelling too much on it won’t make it any better.\n",
    "\n",
    "*TIP* – Rather than having a fear of failure, it is important to prepare and plan for it so as to recover much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that once you overcome a failure in your business and pick up valuable lessons from it, you become stronger, your business benefits from it and you set strategies to prevent the same from happening in future.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Trying to maintain your normal lifestyle*\n",
    "\n",
    "Has your life always involved Friday evening dates with friends, watching and following up all Premier league matches or never missing out on all the latest parties and concerts in town?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if you have chosen the path of entrepreneurship, you should be ready to make major changes including working longer hours and focusing more energy on your business compared to your social life.\n",
    "\n",
    "*TIP* – One thing entrepreneurship does is make you more focused since you now have this new responsibility, extra bills to pay, investors holding you accountable and people looking up to you every month for salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your business to make it through the first years, you need a strong network of friends to support you. Despite the sacrifices you’ll need to make, always think long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Thinking you have no competitors*\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the initial excitement of a new business idea, most new entrepreneurs get carried away by their idea and they think they have no direct competitors or their idea is way better than current solutions in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the reality is no matter how innovative your idea is, someone else is most likely to come up with a better idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "The competitive business environment in the 21st Century also makes it quite challenging to monopolize a certain market because once people see how great you are doing, they will quickly pick out your weaknesses and come up with a better product/service.\n",
    "\n",
    "*TIP* – To be on the safer side, do adequate research on competition before launching your business. Ensure your business has a better value proposition and your business model fills a gap in the market.\n",
    "\n",

    "16/03/2022, 7:37 pm - +254 742 304047: *LAND VS CAR: WHICH ONE SHOULD COME FIRST?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Investments either in a piece of land or a vehicle is all about buyer preference. But there has always been a divisive debate on what between the two should come first. So which ought to come first?\n",
    "\n",
    "Andrew Kari, 28, is thinking about investing within a year or so. For young men and women about his age and are just about done with the hippy and adventurous lifestyle, two investment options feature prominently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should it be a car or a parcel of land?\n",
    "\n",
    "“After three years of an adventurous young life and miserly contract and commission jobs, I now earn enough to allow me to pay my rent, service and utility bills, buy my food and clothing, enjoy the pleasures of life and have enough to save,” Kari begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "“At the moment, I am unable to invest in both options. I am in the process of deciding on which one to take first. Friends and family have advised differently on what should be my first investment option, so I am yet to decide,” he says of the choice between a car and land.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I have thought of investing in my first car, a sports car maybe, for about Sh. 1.2 million; a BMW, perhaps. This would mostly be for status sake because I do not live far from my workplace and commuting is not a hustle. I do not have a family yet. I also have in mind that the status car may not be suitable for when I have a growing family.\n",
    "\n",
    "“My other investment option is land, as buying a ready house is still beyond me. I have talked to a number of my friends and family, and most of my male age mates advise that I buy a car, arguing that it is still too early to get into serious investments like land. They say that a car will not only be a statement, but also be an easier way to move from one ‘happening’ joint to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "“My family, especially my mum, is open to whatever my heart desires, but she is more inclined towards me investing in land. She says that even if I do not build on it, land value appreciates with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am yet to decide, but I am leaning towards the land option more and more, because with time, I will have a family of my own that will need to be sheltered in a bigger house. That means paying more rent, though I also know that they will need to move here and there, and a car will come in handy then.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Kariuki Waweru, a property valuer and real estate investment advisor, says it will make more economic sense for Kari to invest in a parcel of land or a two-bedroom apartment.\n",
    "\n",
    "“At the end of seven years, the value of the car will have depreciated to about 30 to 40 per cent of its initial value, and may need a change of many parts or even its whole body,” says Mr Waweru.\n",
    "\n",
    "“On the other hand, real estate is durable, and the land underneath a development is practically indestructible. It can also be bought with the expectation of attaining a better return on investment,” Waweru adds.\n",
    "\n",
    "He argues that it is also probable that the car owner will still be living in a rented house and thinking of buying a bigger car to fit their new position at work or the growing family.\n",
    "\n",
    "He says: “If this math holds true, in seven years, one who chooses to invest in the vehicle will have forfeited owning a two-bedroom master en suite apartment in the outskirts of the capital city, or buying a plot of land and building a house to shelter his/her family.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Cash is always in short supply for many university students and saving is the last thing on their minds. However, Moses Muriithi went against the grain and started saving to raise capital for a real estate business when he was a third-year student at Kenyatta University.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Muriithi dreamt of going into business straight from campus and he was determined to raise capital at all costs. That he saved part of the Higher Education Loans Board (HELB) credit is a testimony to his burning desire to realize this ambition.\n",
    "\n",
    "His target from the start was real estate business and immediately after stepping out of campus he set up his company known as Fanaka.\n",
    "\n",
    "“While in the university I did online jobs such as data entry and website designs and got paid through PayPal. Whatever I earned I used to invest in land,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "“By the time I started Fanaka in 2015 I already had several plots to start with. As a result of my small earnings together with some cash I had saved from HELB loans I had some Sh.40,000 which I used as capital.”\n",
    "\n",
    "He used part of this amount to acquire an online account which he used to source contracts from foreign organizations for IT-related tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Mostly I handled web designing and data entry where I could earn up to Sh.100,000 a month,” he explains adding that after four years he had already accumulated five 50 by 100 plots valued up to Sh1.4 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "His firm has now made great strides, handling a long list of customers. It focuses on low and average income earners who are looking to own land or house on the outskirts of Nairobi.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Our projects mainly target people who under normal circumstances wouldn’t be considered wealthy. Our average price for land is Sh.450,000,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Most of the pieces of land we sell range from an eighth to a quarter of an acre.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The company, which operates in Ruai area of Nairobi, has already completed six projects in the past 12 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Already we have completed two projects in Kamulu and Joska, one in Ruiru East, another one in Kamakis, Ruiru and one in Malaa,” he reveals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In two years the enterprise has grown rapidly, recording a Sh.80 million turnover last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Our profit margins are low but we strive to make a lot of sales to earn more,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "He has eight people employees who are on permanent terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To attract customers, the firm ensures that the pieces of land it sells are in good locations with necessary amenities such as water, electricity and all weather roads.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This makes it possible for clients to develop them. That these plots are not far from the city is also our high selling point,” Mr Muriithi says.\n",
    "\n",
    "The firm also ensures it conducts due diligence on all transactions to ward off fraud. The integrity of the deals, he says, has given his firm an edge in a sector swamped by con artists swindling unsuspecting victims.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We ensure the plots have ready titles to facilitate the client’s in doing the search at the lands offices before they commit themselves. We also make sure the plots are affordable to even low income earners, with some of our plots going for as low as Sh.300,000,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entrepreneur credits his success to their flexible modes of payment where a client can pay 30 per cent deposit and the balance paid in one year. The firm is also tapping on social media, property sites and their website, fanaka.co.ke as marketing and advertising tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as any business, Mr Muriith’s venture is not short of challenges, the key of which is getting enough funds for expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Also land brokers who at times exaggerate land prices have proven to be a thorn in the flesh, but with time we have managed to deal with them,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "His advice to those new in business (Real estate companies in Kenya) is to ensure integrity and transparency reigns adding that clients keep referring other people because of the trust created.\n",
    "\n",
    "“They also need to be patient. It took me about 4 months in business to sell the first plot,” he adds as he challenges his fellow youth to create job opportunities instead of waiting to be employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "The story of wealth creation is the back-bone of the structures that exist in our society today. At one point in time, we are all at the starting point (like in a marathon race). \n",
    "\n",
    "We all live in a bucket-carrying world. But who are you? Are you a bucket carrier or a pipeline builder?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the bucket-carrying strategy is that it gets a bit tiring and monotonous with time. And you can easily find yourself jobless anytime – which means the concept of a “secure job” is actually an illusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intelligent, wealthy people are pipeline builders. Make a point of joining them today.\n",

    "17/03/2022, 12:33 pm - +254 701 711058: *THE FRENCH BEANS FARMING SIDE-HUSTLE THAT CAN MAKE YOU KSH.100,000 PER MONTH*\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you been thinking of tapping into the benefits of Kenya’s export market in the Euro and the United States? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, believe you me, you can start your own small venture right now and be a part of those who feed the nations. \n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to think about planting French beans and in less than 2 months you will be thinking of exporting your first produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "French beans grow in warm-wet parts of the country. These are areas like Thika, Murang’a, Machakos, parts of Kajiado, Uasin Gishu, Nakuru, Western Kenya and Kisumu. The soil has to be well drained and water supply should be adequate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Getting Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t invest in French beans until you consult local export agents for mentorship, training and market advice. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very important step because these are the institutions that will buy from you and sell the produce at the international market.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to talk to them so that you can familiarize with the right kinds of crop species, chemicals and packaging methods prior to making an investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fresh Produce Exporters Association of Kenya (Located in New Rehema House, Rhapta Road, Westlands)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Homegrown Kenya Limited\n",
    "\n",
    "*VegPro Kenya Limited\n",
    "\n",
    "*Wamu Enterprises\n",
    "\n",
    "*Everest Enterprises\n",
    "\n",
    "*Kenya Horticultrual Exports Limited (KHE)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Find arable land and prepare it*\n",
    "\n",
    "An acre of land typical costs Ksh.10,000 to Ksh.20,000 to lease per year. The best land (ideally) is one that is near an international airport so the export agents can easily access your farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those targeting Nairobi may want to think of areas like Murang’a, Gatundu, Kirinyaga, Mua Hills, Ngong and Ngoliba. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lease land can also be found in places like Mwea although the soils in those areas tend to be depleted of minerals due to years and years of intensive farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Find seeds and plant*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your export agent will be able to advice you on the best seeds, fertilizers and chemicals to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, an acre of land requires a 25Kg bag of seeds which costs Ksh.22,000 on average (1 seed per hole). Note that with irrigation French beans can be grown throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Basic Farming Tips*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Land should be ploughed and furrowed before planting season\n",
    "\n",
    "*Single rows of 30cmx15cm or double rows of 60cmx30cm are recommended\n",
    "\n",
    "*You will require about 80 Kgs DAP and 60Kgs of CAN fertilizer per acre. NPK fertilizer may also be used on less fertile land to stimulate crop flowering.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pesticides like “Confidor” and “Thunder” can be used\n",
    "\n",
    "*The harvest*\n",
    "\n",
    "French beans take around 50 days to mature after which you can harvest them over the next 8 weeks. On average an acre piece of land can yield 4 to 6 tonnes of crop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, because these are highly perishable crops, it is important to harvest when there’s ready market.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much to Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to start a fully-fledged farm (including leasing the farm, ploughing, irrigation, seeds, labour, fertilizer and chemicals) you will need to set aside a budget of at least Ksh.130,000. This cost may actually reduce with successive planting seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much to Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "During the high season (September to March), you can sell a Kilogram of your produce at an average price of Ksh.100. Thus if you harvest 5 tonnes from your acre piece of land over period of 2 months then the returns would amount to Ksh.500,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The low season in this business lasts between April and August and prices per kilo tend to plummet to Ksh.50 on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not a must to become a full-time farmer in order to engage in this business. And you don’t need to be a landowner either. \n",
    "\n",
    "All you need to do is get mentorship from those who understand the business of exporting products, lease a piece of land near your current place of residence, hire labourers and only visit the farm once or twice a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, YES, you can actually start this as a side-hustle as you explore further options to enhance your investment strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Business Plan Writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business plan writing is a very important part of every business venture and that is why you hear about it very often.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every entrepreneur will tell you they are allergic to loses. Nobody starts a business to make losses, but to post profits. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many secrets of making profits that most entrepreneurs are not armed with. Such secrets are possessed by entrepreneurs who have made it in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general mistake we all make is to overestimate the amount of money we will make from our business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our thought usually goes like, “If I start business A, in the next three months I will make XXX amount of money”\n",
    "\n",
    "Don`t overestimate your possible earning. In fact, I will advise you to instead underestimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you sit down and see that the possible profit you will be making monthly in the next six months is #100,000, then assume it`s going to be #50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important?\n",
    "\n",
    "So that you won`t be disappointed if your estimated profit doesn`t work the way you plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people have walked out of their businesses because of their unhealthy expectations. If you expect too much too soon, if it doesn`t work out, you will be highly depressed and may be tempted to forsake the whole business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be reasonable in your expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making profits means travelling a journey towards wealth and financial freedom, which is why you should follow the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Don’t mix friendship with business*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make profits, the owner of a business should separate friendship with business; this is the only way you can ensure that your business survives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember some friends are not happy that you are running the business; some of them may be on a mission to finish you so that you can fall to their standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mind should always focus on business… even if it means losing a friend so as to make profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Be consistent*\n",
    "\n",
    "In business, being predictable is what your customer expects from you. If you are running a restaurant ensure that the food you provide today is the same food you provide tomorrow and in future. You are allowed to add stock but don’t make a mistake of not preparing a meal that was available yesterday unless no one is ordering it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always ensure that opening and closing hours of your business is known to customers regardless of circumstances. If you fail to open today, your customer will move to the next shop and if they find the product is the same as yours then you are likely to lose him.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Have the right staff*\n",
    "\n",
    "Having the right staff is the key ingredient of a successful business. Your staff will either chase away customers or build an empire for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you are seeking staff, conduct the exercise professionally; mixing bribery, nepotism and tribalism may not help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been proved that most businesses are killed by relatives and people you think they can help you. It’s good to hire someone you are not related because, you will have all the courage to question him/her on issues related to the business than a friend or relative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The right staffs always know if they mess up your business, they will face the full force of law and no one will interfere, but in most cases if your relatives messes, your community might interfere thus affecting your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Monitor every coin that comes from the business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Business is all about profits unless you are running a Non-profit Organization. In order to make a profit you must monitor every coin that goes in and out of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day ensure that stock count is done then ensure that your employees explain each and every detail of the transactions. You may not be physically there but you can have efficient systems to monitor the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Motivate your employees*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where most business owners go wrong and it has resulted to many businesses collapsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you start treating all employees as thieves, you give them little time to rest, you don’t motivate them with awards, leave, end year party, then know that they will gang against you and kill your business.\n",
    " \n",
    "Employees can be dangerous and the earlier you realize that they are important the better, otherwise you will regret!\n",
    "\n",
    "Invest in your employees, give them good salaries and make them feel part of the company, that’s the only way you can see results.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Don’t focus on competitors, focus on the product*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every business has competitors and if you want to beat the competitors don’t concentrate on what they are doing but concentrate on the quality of the products and services you are offering.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you focus more on competitors you will lose direction and mess up your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Employ strategy*\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategy is an important aspect of running a successful business. Without strategy, you will not beat competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*8. Sell unique products*\n",
    "\n",
    "Being unique means standing out. It might take time to break-even but once you have entered the market and people have tested your product, you will make it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*9. Know the taste of your customers*\n",
    "\n",
    "Business is all about what customers want not what you think is right for your customers. Once you have identified the taste of your customers, your business will boom.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned earlier, don`t over estimate the amount of money you can make in the next one year. Instead, underestimate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus to that is that you shouldn`t be discouraged by the result you will get when you just start a new business. It takes time for a seed to germinate, grow and bear fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as you are committed to your business and keep on learning, you will grow, make much money and transit yourself from being a small business owner to being a successful entrepreneur.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wish you best of luck in your business.\n",

    " \n",
    "Is entrepreneurship a solution to the massive unemployment challenge in the country?\n",
    " \n",
    "Some would argue that young people should rely on their own hustles to make a living due to the huge gap between available jobs and the number of qualified people.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, other people are of the view that entrepreneurship is a tough game that has its own obstacles such as raising capital, acquiring licenses and the huge rate of entrepreneurship ventures that have failed.\n",
    " \n",
    "This was an interesting conversation I had with Joyce Wagaki, an entrepreneur who started from scratch and is slowly building her brand in African inspired fashion.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you had told her 5 years ago that she would be a successful entrepreneur, Joyce would have laughed that idea off as impossible. \n",
    "\n",
    "How could she be an entrepreneur yet she was a Journalism and Media Studies graduate, with an amazing voice and a ‘bright future’ in the media industry?\n",
    "\n",
    "“Before I graduated, I got a 3 month internship at a leading media house. We did a voice test and my voice set me apart from the other interns landing me reporting duties both on radio and on the lunch hour T.V bulletin. I knew then that my goal in life was to be a news reporter and eventually become a news anchor.” Joyce said.\n",
    " \n",
    "After finally graduating from media school, Joyce was positive it wouldn’t be long before she got a job. She prepared her C.V and her Cover letter and started applying for reporting jobs in the media. \n",
    "\n",
    "She didn’t get any positive responses immediately but she kept applying, kept working on her C.V and following up on the jobs she had applied for.\n",
    "\n",
    "About 3 years after her graduation with no success in getting employment, Joyce’s sister who was accommodating her in Nairobi got another opportunity in China leaving Joyce to fend for herself while sending her money from time to time for her upkeep.\n",
    " \n",
    "Seeing her job applications for news reporter/news anchor were not bearing any fruits, she went an extra mile and sent her C.V with voice recordings of herself hoping this would set her apart. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately no station picked her and this left Joyce frustrated and disappointed.\n",
    " \n",
    "“I knew I couldn’t go back home because I did not want to burden my parents. Even though my sister supported me, I still needed my independence.”\n",
    " \n",
    "One day, Joyce’s sister saw some handbags in China which had unique prints. Amazingly, the bags were so cheap. She reached out to Joyce and asked her if she would be interested in selling the bags in Kenya.\n",
    " \n",
    "“At first I was reluctant because I had never thought of being an entrepreneur. However, my sister convinced me to give it a try since one of my strengths was the ability to convince people.”\n",
    " \n",
    "Joyce’s sister sent the first batch of 20 bags and 20 ear rings. True to her word, the bags had a unique design and print compared to the bags in the market then.\n",
    " \n",
    "“I knew that my livelihood depended on the sale of those bags and ear rings so I did everything I could to sell them. I started by selling to my close friends and church mates. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also went to town daily with a backpack stashed with some bags and walked office by office selling the bags. Sometimes, I didn’t make any sales, I had to deal with some clients who were so rude but that did not deter me.”\n",
    " \n",
    "However, this whole time, her mind was still set in the media. She sold bags during the day and in the evening, she did her recordings and kept applying for jobs.\n",
    " \n",
    "“Impressively, I managed to sell all the 20 bags and ear rings and made a profit of Ksh.30,000. My sister had bought and shipped the bags and ear rings at only Ksh.10,000 in China. Since the bags were unique, I sold them at Ksh.800 and Ksh.1000 per bag and the ear rings at Ksh.250.”\n",
    " \n",
    "This experience made Joyce rethink her initial decision of being employed full time in the media to actually taking entrepreneurship more seriously. \n",
    "\n",
    "Her sister kept sending her bags from China and with time, she expanded her collection to leather bags which were more official compared to the printed ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "She even opened a face book page, (Bags and Leather) to take advantage of the online market.\n",
    " \n",
    "Joyce sold the bags for a while and the returns were great, she was able to pay her bills but due to unavoidable circumstances, the bags business was not sustainable.\n",
    " \n",
    "“I had to think on my feet since I couldn’t keep running an unsustainable business and I still had financial obligations. I thought of going back to applying for jobs but considering how far I had come, this wasn’t an option for me.” Joyce said.\n",
    " \n",
    "One day Joyce had gone to Eastleigh to meet up a friend. However, as is the typical Kenyan style, her friend kept her waiting for over an hour.\n",
    " \n",
    "“I was so frustrated when my friend eventually never showed up and called to cancel our meeting. Instead of wasting my day, I decided to take a walk around Eastleigh and window shop because Eastleigh was popular for getting quality items at affordable prices.”\n",
    " \n",
    "As she was window shopping, Joyce met some ladies selling deras. At the time, she didn’t even know what deras were and deras were still a new concept in Nairobi.\n",
    " \n",
    "“I got curious and asked the lady to tell me more about deras, how much they cost, how they are made, e.t.c. She sold me a material for Ksh.300 then directed me to a tailor who sew the dera for me at only 50 shillings and in a few minutes, the dera was ready.”\n",
    " \n",
    "Joyce was so impressed with the end result that she wore the dera to church the next Sunday. Being a lover of taking photos, she took a photo of herself wearing the dera and posted it on facebook that Sunday evening.\n",
    " \n",
    "“When I woke up the next day, I was surprised to get a lot of requests from my comment section and inbox from people who loved the dera and wanted one for themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was so shocked by the numerous requests but I also saw this as a great business opportunity. Also most people perceived Eastleigh to be unsafe and I took advantage of that by being the middle person between the traders and my clients.”\n",
    " \n",
    "However, Joyce still hadn’t figured out how she would run the dera business since she needed people’s sizes thus each dera needed to be custom made. So she asked people to send her their measurements and design preferences and she would ensure they get their deras delivered to them at a fee.\n",
    " \n",
    "That was when Joyce opened Gaki Collections, a face book page that she used to sell deras.\n",
    " \n",
    "“With time, one of my clients asked me if she could get African sandals to wear with her dera. At that time, I had no idea where I would get African sandals but one lesson entrepreneurship had taught me was, You do not tell a client No, Just say Yes and figure it out later.”\n",
    " \n",
    "That is exactly how Joyce started the Gaki collection sandal line which consists of custom made sandals tailored to a client’s needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "All a client needs to do is send details of their shoe size, what color and design they would like their sandals to have and Joyce makes sure she gets the sandals made and delivered anywhere in the country.\n",
    " \n",
    "Since my business was purely online, I knew there was more to social media and in order for my business and brand to grow, I needed to pick up social media and digital marketing skills.\n",
    " \n",
    "“That is when the She Goes Digital program came along. Through the program, I learnt how to boost my page, make use of online ads and figure out details such as what time my audience is active online.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made use of the skills I gained through the program and by the end of 2017, I had shipped my goods to Ghana, Liberia and U.S.A and I got even more clients online.”\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",

    "18/03/2022, 3:45 pm - +254 701 711058: *START A SMALL ORNAMENTAL FISH BUSINESS IN KENYA; BE YOUR OWN BOSS*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ornamental fish business in Kenya is estimated to grow at a steady pace over the next 15 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite the growing domestic demand, very few of our local entrepreneurs seem to have taken up this idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the niche-specific market has had to contend with an under-supply for many years. In fact, the vast majority of ornamental fish sold in Kenya and Africa in general are imported mostly from Israel, Eastern Europe and Far East.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as we found out during our research, breeding of tropical ornamentals is usually a small-scale business, and there is nothing really complicated or high-tech about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can therefore start your own smallholding today, and begin supplying nearby retail shops with cheaper and high-quality fish without the costs of international transport, customs clearance and the stress to the fish associated with being transported for many hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can produce better fish quality than the imported stock and how you can make money out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Getting Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "First you will need to find a suitable location for your venture. An ideal ground is one that has adequate supply of water, preferably located in an environment that is neither too hot nor too cold (23 degrees to 28 degrees temperature is recommended).\n",
    "\n",
    "As such most of Nairobi, Central Kenya, Central Rift, Western, Nyanza and Coast would be ideal places to begin your search for land. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Build a Pond*\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical liner pond costs about Ksh.30,000 to construct. The size of the pond will depend on the number of fish you want to keep. For instance, a 250ft X 250ft pond is adequate for 3000 ornamental fish.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can seek help from the National Aquaculture Research Development and Training Centre in Sagana Kirinyaga County for additional advice on best practices of ornamental fish farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Buy Fingerlings*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start with as few as 60 ornamental fish fingerlings. Small gold fish fingerlings cost Ksh.150 (estimate) each, Black Molly cost Ksh.400 each and Orandas Ksh.500 each. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can mix these three species to provide diversity to your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4: Manage The Farm*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ornamental fish are best fed using flakes and pellets. The water in the pond also needs to be changed at least once every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fish normally reach maturity in 1 to 2 years, and although they can live up to 20 or more years, as a commercial farmer, you will want to begin exploring the option of selling them as early as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 5: Build Aquarium Tanks (Optional)*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose to sell your fish directly to people who make aquariums or you can learn the art (of making aquarium boxes) yourself so that you can tap in even more profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, an empty aquarium box measuring one-and-half square feet currently goes for Ksh.10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 6: How To Market Your Fish*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ornamental fish are priced per inch. Hence, the longer the fish, the bigger the price tag on it. For instance, a 6 inch gold fish (priced at Ksh.150/- per inch) will attract Ksh.1,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since an aquarium is a lovely sight to behold that uses minimal electricity power in the house, you can market your product directly to homeowners, commercial offices or even schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also look up some high-end malls in the city (such as Yaya Center and Sarit Center) for potential market. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in other words, the market is readily available…you only need to be good at prospecting and pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Dos*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Visit the National Aquaculture Research Development and Training Centre or their agents for training and mentorship.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Consult with farmers who are already in this business to get an idea of the challenges they encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Consult a few buyers in your area or region to get an idea of the kind of quality they are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Don’ts*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Don’t overcrowd your fish in the pond (1 inch of fish per 4 litres of water is recommended).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Don’t add too many new fish into your pond at one time, get a few first and see how they adjust to their new home.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Don’t use pesticides near your pond, generally maintain high hygiene standards around the fish.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "Building the pond will cost you about Ksh.30,000 and buying new fingerlings will cost you about Ksh.20,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can start with 60 fish, which if well fed and maintained, can multiply to over 10,000 in a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you sell half of the fish (5,000) per year with each fish priced at Ksh.500 then you can expect a sale volume of Ksh.2.5 million. \n",
    "\n",
    "And since the cost of maintaining a pond isn’t that high, then you can look forward to a pretty decent profit margin of around 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s an old saying that goes, “opportunities are missed because they come dressed in overalls and look like work.” \n",
    "\n",
    "So today, you can make a choice whether to spot an opportunity or to fear work and continue blaming others for your misfortunes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ornamental fish farming in Kenya presents a wonderful opportunity for anyone, young or old, to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Business Plan Writing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Which street would you rather host your business on? Downtown or the CBD. Or maybe in the outskirts of the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot comes to mind when you think of a business location. Nowadays, business is even virtual, and with no specific location. However, at some point, people will have to come to your store or shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a strategic business location is one thing you want to do right. You get this right, and you are on to a good start. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever seen businesses fighting over a spot? \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a hot spot like a wi-fi. There are those specific places with a strong network. In business terms, there are those corners or streets with most clients. Willing buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I challenge you to walk on any city or town streets, and you will notice that some shop space cost way more than others despite being in the same city or town. \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is simply the location. This is an obvious thing. If you want a shop within the CBD, let’s say Tom mboya street in Nairobi, that might be like Ksh.50,000 per month for rent. It can even be as much as Ksh.90,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "That pricing can be justified considering the crazy human traffic in that street, Tom Mboya is the main street in Nairobi city, and thus business space is expensive. You will definitely get clients, and that rent will pay itself in two to five days. And by the time you clear your stock, you will be glad you put your products or services on that part of town.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to get a good business spot?*\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the motivation for getting a good place is to get clients – not just clients but customers with the buying power. You don’t want your business in a bad part of town with only window shoppers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing you will notice about a good business location is that it is very pricey. It costs an arm and a leg to get a store in the CBD of any city. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are just starting out and you don’t have enough money for a strategic business spot, instead of putting your business in the rundown part of town where you can be robbed, I would suggest you share a spot with another like-minded individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how it is done here in Nairobi, and in any city in Kenya. This is simple and let me explain how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you want to sell clothes, and you find someone who wants to sell shoes, why can’t you guys be in the same space, share the rent and even share customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "I can go into the shop and get both clothes and shoes in one spot without having to move around. This is convenient for both the customer and the business owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can give many more examples of this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another common one is between an M-Pesa agent and any other business stall. It could be a food joint or a mobile shop. If you walk into any business shop in Nairobi town, you are likely to find an M-Pesa guy within. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are putting efforts together to share the cost of the rent. I can just come to that shop, withdraw my money from the M-Pesa guy and go ahead and buy whatever I want within.\n",
    "\n",
    "*No Partner, go virtual.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason for wanting a specific business location is to have access to the crazy traffic they give to your business. It is the exposure that your business gets by being on that busy street that you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another way you can get to expose your business even without that spot on the CBD. And that is what we all know as social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a business account or page for your shop on social media and promote your products there. Look for a delivery guy who will be dropping items to your clients, and you are good to go. Most young businesses that can’t afford a location do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just open an Instagram account and get it running.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good physical spot alone is not enough in this digital era. You also need to boost the traffic to your shop by marketing your business on Instagram and Facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "How will I know that a shop in Moi Avenue has beautiful dresses? \n",
    "\n",
    "By seeing their sample photos on Instagram or Facebook. And then I will easily locate it because the street is in an open and safe place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Nairobi is ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the world appearing at position 97. Rental accommodation was found to be high among other services.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this high cost of rentals in the capital city especially in the CBD that is forcing small-scale traders to think out of the box by considering e-commerce in place of rental shops.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I know of my neighbours who were running a small jewellery shop who are now selling their goods online after packing out last year to operate from home,” said John Mungai who runs men’s cloth business along Tom Mboya Street in the CBD.\n",
    "\n",
    "He says that most of the shops around charges up to Sh.25,000 a month depending on the size and still the traders have to sort out the city council taxmen.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how are these small-scale traders who have decided to go online operate their businesses and still make good profits?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will realise that today there are many social media pages with advertisements of people selling goods and services. Most of them are individuals posting shoes, clothes, electronic accessories and cutleries among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "No wonder you frequently come across the messages “please retweet, my next client could be on your timeline”\n",
    "\n",
    "Trust me, once such people find their footing in online business, certainly they will not go renting shops or go back there if they ever had one before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly, e-commerce is eating up the rental business slowly in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Recap*\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen business literally fight over spots. A good market that makes their business bring in more revenue. It is the same way major corporations fight over certain markets that are likely to bring in revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is all about where the buyers are. And buyers are not only looked for physically in this era, you can equally go online. By online here I mean social media and classified ads sites like jiji.co.ke\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Business Plan Writing.\n",

    "19/03/2022, 7:30 pm - +254 742 304047: *5 LESSONS PEOPLE NEED IN THEIR 20s BUT NEVER LEARN UNTIL 70s*\n",
    " \n",
    "In this article, I would like to talk about our life and how we are living it.\n",
    " \n",
    "After observing the world for about 15 years, here is my conclusion; the greatest problem of mankind is that, the young lack wisdom, and the old lack strength.\n",
    " \n",
    "When we are young, we have zeal, physical strength, and an open mind to dare life and break grounds. Unfortunately, most people lack wisdom when they are young, so those capacities which come with youth are often wasted.\n",
    " \n",
    "When people grow old, they acquire wisdom about life but there they are, age 60, 65 or even 75, they are weak, have more fears and closed not adventurous.\n",
    " \n",
    "Here is what you can wish for, the combination of wisdom and strength which essentially means that if as a young person you seek wisdom, your life will be far better than that of most people.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Success is whatever it means to you*\n",
    " \n",
    "Today when people say, “I want to be successful”, they often mean that they want to be millionaires. Money is so significant to success that a teenager commented on social media sometimes ago that he wanted to become a billionaire. Come on, nobody should ever start life by dreaming to become a billionaire.\n",
    " \n",
    "What exactly does being a billionaire mean to a 16-year-old? How much money does he think a billion contains and what in the world does he think he needs such money for? Or may I ask, does he think such money will ever make him the happiest human in the world?\n",
    " \n",
    "Let me tell you the truth most people don’t know; the way the world defines success is dumb. Success is not when you are Bill Gates. Success is when you are you. Success is when you know yourself enough to know what you were created to do and do it.\n",
    " \n",
    "Yes, everyone needs money to pay bills and I strongly advocate that young people should learn how money works so that they can have enough of it but money is like oxygen. An everyday human inhales like 11,000 liters of oxygen every day.\n",
    " \n",
    "If for whatever reason you don’t have enough oxygen to inhale, that’s a big problem but if you have 1 billion liters of oxygen all around you, your body still won’t need more than what you need.\n",
    " \n",
    "That is money. If you don’t have enough to cover your basic needs, you are in trouble but after you have your necessities covered, Ferarri and Rolex watches add nothing to your life.\n",
    " \n",
    "Success to you may be to be a father, be a great father. Success to you may be to save lives by working in a hospital, do just that. Success to you may be to be a wife, do it. Success to you may be to live in the woods, just do it.\n",
    " \n",
    "Because we all focus on billions, most of us neglect the real thing that ought to make them happy and when we are in our 70s and look back at life, we see that we have done nothing but pursued the wind.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Death is better than mediocrity*\n",
    "\n",
    "When I was in primary school, I often saw an old, wretched man whenever we were coming from school. This man was so poor that even though my family was poor, I called him poor.\n",
    " \n",
    "Looking at that man, I would tell myself, “I will rather die than to grow up and become like this man”.\n",
    " \n",
    "To me, as a young adult, I didn’t think there was much difference between death and mediocrity. If you live an unhappy life, you are dead anyway.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you accept whatever life throws at you instead of fighting for what you deserve, you are dead anyway. If you are living just like everyone, pursuing shadows, well, Benjamin Frankly said, “Most people die at 25 but are not buried until 75”.\n",
    " \n",
    "Living doesn’t mean the same thing as being alive but most people don’t know this. They live all their lives in fear of death until when they are old and realize that the real death happens when a man agrees to live for food and clothes. When the sense of purpose is lost, life itself is lost.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Mistakes are the way we learn*\n",
    " \n",
    "Mark Twain said, “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”\n",
    " \n",
    "The human mind is very good at exaggerating negative things so you are likely to think that if you leave the job you hate you will regret it for the rest of your life, If you start a business and lost all your money you will regret it for the rest of your life, If you follow your dream and it doesn’t work, you will never recover from it, but the opposite is the truth; failures rarely harm us. In fact, it’s the greatest of all teachers.\n",
    " \n",
    "Most humans avoid failures all their lives only for them to be old and look back to see that all those ugly failures they experienced actually taught them great lessons and if they had tried more things, they would have had far better lives.\n",
    " \n",
    "*You are the most important human in the world*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have an interesting memory of one day when I saw one of my university classmates with a very expensive phone. I simply couldn’t understand why a student would want to buy such a phone.\n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "*Keep feeding your mind*\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Subscribe to informative blogs so that you keep getting updates whenever new (useful) articles are posted.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Bring your creativity to life*\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you a creative person? Then, why not take a leap into freelance work? By freelance work, we are talking about things like: selling art merchandise, manicure services, working online, venture into agri-business.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Give out your services for free (Volunteer)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not join a niche specific volunteer organization in your area and start offering your expertise for free? \n",

    "*Sell some services to people in your estate/village*\n",

    "\n",
    "A good number of Kenyan entrepreneurs have wrong reasons or misplaced reasons as to why they want to start a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of them start with the primary goal of either to make a lot of money, not to answer to anyone apart from themselves not looking at the fact that these are benefits that come after a longer period of your business being successful. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best reason one would decide to start a business would be having passion, love, and a strong belief in the business venture you want to get into. And you have done a proper investigation that your product/service will fill a market gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to have determination, patience to be able to make it in the business world. Every time you get a challenge it should give you more motivation to grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before plunging into the world of entrepreneurship, check if your heart is in the right place. Here are some of the wrong reasons to become an entrepreneur.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You want to make a lot of money.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to become an entrepreneur for the sole reason of getting rich, you will soon find yourself disappointed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a business wouldn’t make you an overnight billionaire. It takes a lot of hard work, motivation  and creativity in order for your business to be profitable and eventually succeed. \n",
    "\n",
    "If having lots of money is your only motivation to become an entrepreneur, it will hinder your ability to make long-term decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it will make you feel unsatisfied if you don’t hit your target numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You want to become famous.*\n",
    "\n",
    "So you want to start your own business to become the next Mark Zuckerberg? \n",
    "\n",
    "Becoming an entrepreneur can really increase your personal visibility particularly if your marketing strategy involves a lot of media exposure. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, focusing more on personal branding opportunities for the sake of gaining popularity might get your business into trouble. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You want to prove someone wrong.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Establishing a business must be driven by your desire to solve a problem or serve people, not to prove a point to someone else or take revenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should come from your passion, talent and skills in order for it to be sustainable. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You want to have unlimited vacations.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Since entrepreneurs can take control of their own schedule and working hours, many believe that becoming one entitles them to have unlimited vacation time. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the reality is that the success of your business largely depends on the effort you put in it. This means investing enough time in your business to build it, grow it and help it become successful. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You want to make other people happy.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every entrepreneur dreams of making the world a better place. They want to make clients happy, care for their employees and build a great team. \n",
    "\n",
    "If making others happy becomes your top priority, there’s a high probability that you will be making poor business decisions like prioritizing unprofitable clients or keeping unproductive workers in your company. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that your primary responsibility is to protect and nurture your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You want to serve a small market.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most entrepreneurs start a business without even considering if it’s scalable. \n",
    "\n",
    "While targeting a small market may work for start-ups, you should be able to envision a bigger market in the long run in order for your business to last. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You are good at something.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Being good in something isn’t enough to keep a business afloat. In order for your company to survive, you should have a clear vision for your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You have got nothing to do*\n",
    "\n",
    "Building business for no reason can result into tragedy. While it’s true that anyone can become a business owner, it’s important that you have right motivation to increase its chance of succeeding. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You want to be in charge*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most wannabe entrepreneurs think that starting a business would automatically give them a higher status in the society. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being a business owner is more than putting the title CEO on your business card or being in charge of something. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to be able to solve a problem and bridge a gap when you build a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Everyone is doing it!*\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a fat chance that you have no concrete plan nor the basic knowledge of starting a business. You have the impression that anyone can be a business owner so you go right ahead and do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurship is a path that is often fantasized about by a good number of us; we think about what it would be like to establish and run a business of our own. \n",
    "\n",
    "But are we getting into it for all the “wrong” reasons?\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes the right kind of commitment to become a successful entrepreneur but if it embodies the wrong kind of motivation then it will likely result in job dissatisfaction, burn outs, or failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore think wisely why you want to ventures into a particular business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Business Plan Writing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Business plan writing is a very important part of every business venture and that is why you hear about it very often.\n",

    "21/03/2022, 4:48 pm - +254 701 711058: *THE UNTOLD TRUTH WHY BUILDING RENTALS [REAL ESTATE] IS NOT ALWAYS A WISE INVESTMENT IDEA*\n",
    "\n",
    "“So John and your chama what are you going to invest in if you win this Ksh.5 Million cheque?” Asked the TV programme presenter. \n",
    "\n",
    "John, like most us would do, grinned and responded “We are planning to buy a plot and construct rentals.” \n",
    "\n",
    "I had been watching this Chama show for about one month and 90% of those interviewed said that if they managed to win the overall prize they would definitely aspire to become landlords. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, as it turns out, real estate as an investment is quite overrated. The return on investment, if any, is not guaranteed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Worse still it might take you a whole lifetime to turn around the venture to make business sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s Do Some Math.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build rentals, you obviously need land in a fast-growing area where tenants can easily commute to work. Typically that would cost you Ksh.2 million in a place like Utawala, Ruai or Ongata Rongai. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that those places are on the outskirts of the city and may therefore be less attractive to tenants given the traffic jam situation, lack of basic amenities etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing a typical 1 bedroom house would cost you about Ksh 1 Million and since you are doing it for business, you would certainly want to build several. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s say you start by constructing 4 houses. By the time you finish, you will have already coughed out Ksh.6 Million (this figure will be much higher if you use a bank loan to finance).\n",
    "\n",
    "So from that point, the hassle of finding good tenants (because obviously not all tenants are good) starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "If current rental prices in Utawala, Ongata Rongai and Ruai are anything to go by, then you will expect to charge Ksh.10,000 per month in rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming 80% occupancy per year, your total annual income will be something close to Ksh.380,000. Don’t forget, out of this money you will have to deduct land rates, cost of maintaining and repairing the house, electricity bills for security lights, paying the care-taker and cost of handling sewage waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you took a loan to construct the houses (it’s highly unlikely you would undertake such a project on cash basis unless you won a betting jackpot), then your expenses would go up because you would have to clear the loan plus the interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Realistically speaking, your four 1 bedroom apartments would bring you about Ksh.300,000 per year. Of which, even if you decided not to touch a single penny of the rent so that you can repay the loan, it would still take you a minimum of 30 years to get out of debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "So long story short, that would not be a wise investment option especially if capital is a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recent study by Hass Consult, showed that rental prices in Nairobi’s satellite towns e.g. Ngong, Ruaka, Kiserian and Thika fell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mlolongo and Athi River experienced a fall in both land and rental prices. That alone confirms that there’s no guarantee of a better future ahead for a small-scale real estate investor in this part of the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notion that rent prices tend to rise over time is therefore misinformed. Moreover, tenants tend to prefer newer apartments to old ones.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When Jefferson Mwamburi visited his relatives in Thika, he was a young man with little or no experience in agribusiness. Like most 25 year olds he was basically trying to understand his purpose in life and hoping for a better day.\n",
    "\n",
    "He had tried working as a bus conductor in Nairobi but life in the city had proven too expensive and unsustainable for him. He would wake up early in the morning and then spend the rest of his day manoeuvring through the city’s traffic before going to sleep at the wee hours of the night. \n",
    "\n",
    "His measly income coupled by the rising cost of living meant that meeting basic needs was next to impossible. He was not able to save or invest in anything despite working for over 18 hours a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "His trip to Thika, a town within the Nairobi Metropolitan region, was in preparation for yet another longer journey back to his rural area in Taita hills. He had given up in life and he just wanted to retire and focus on peasant farming or something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "But just before he could leave Thika, his host shared 10 guinea fowl eggs with him – a gift for Mwamburi’s ageing father who lived back in the village. Little did the young man know that this was his biggest breakthrough in life yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "When he went back home, he did not give all the eggs to the old man. Instead he gave him 5 eggs and gave the rest to one of the brooding hens in the house to see if they would hatch. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, he was very lucky because out of 5 eggs, 3 hatched. Out of the 3 keets that hatched, 2 were females and one was a male presenting him with a perfect combination for setting up a larger farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was back in 2011 and fast-forward to 2014, Mwamburi’s population of guinea fowls had grown exponentially to 500 birds despite him selling at least 10 birds to local hotels every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the young man from Ndebwa village of Taita Taveta county is popularly referred to as Kijana wa kanga (the young man who farms guinea fowls). \n",
    "\n",
    "His small farm has become a full-time business and already he has established links with two restaurants in Voi town that order mature fowls from his farm on a monthly basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "He sells a mature bird at Ksh.2,000, an egg for Ksh.50 and day-old chicks at Ksh.500.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Low Maintenance*\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Mwamburi, as compared to chicken, guinea fowls require low maintenance. They are free-range animals meaning they can eat insects and weeds in the field and therefore two to three kilos of maize is normally enough to feed his entire farm daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage with keeping guinea fowls over chicken is that they don’t destroy crops. Thus even if you leave them to roam freely in the compound, there will be no conflicts with neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "These birds are also naturally more resistant to poultry diseases. You only need to vaccinate them against Newcastle disease and de-worm regularly after every three to four months.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Expanding His Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from guinea fowls, Mwamburi has expanded his farm to accommodate turkeys and indigenous chicken. He sells a mature turkey at Ksh.5,000 and a three month old one at Ksh.3,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because he is among the few people in Taita Taveta with a KWS license to rear wild birds, he enjoys some sort of monopoly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Demand currently outstrips supply meaning he is able to meet his needs, support his family and invest in expanding his farm as he seeks to tap into a wider market. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mind you, he now works for less than 8 hours a day meaning he is able to spend more quality moments with his loved ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is all not rosy, one challenge he has to grapple with is inbreeding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since few people in the area keep these birds, there is a high chance that closely related fowls may mate and this might produce unhealthy chicks. \n",
    "\n",
    "He overcomes this challenge by buying new cocks regularly from neighbouring farms.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Expert Tips on Guinea Fowl Farming*\n",
    "\n",
    "*It takes about 5 months for a bird to mature and start laying eggs and once they start, they lay a single egg each day for 3 months after which they seek to brood.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In order to venture into this business, you will need a KWS license which can be obtained at the service headquarters in Langata, Nairobi. This goes for Ksh.2,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You can start this business on a small plot of land although you may be required to upgrade as the population grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Guinea fowls are roaming birds and they prefer to walk around freely. They hatch 100% of their eggs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*There are several species of guinea fowls but the “helmeted pearl” is the most popular of them all.\n",
    "\n",
    "*On a good month and with an average farm of 500 birds you can comfortably make Ksh.100,000 in sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "For the former matatu conductor, the sky is the limit. His dream is to set up a big brand and supply the entire coastal area and Kenya at large. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping in mind that he started his venture with nothing in his pockets, his story is a clear revelation that sweat capital is the most important form of investment one can give to their business.\n",

    "\n",
    "So you get Ksh.200,000 which you can use to expand your business further. Easy, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are thinking of joining a Sacco, one of the first things you need to consider is a list of the best SACCOs to invest in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been cases of many Kenyans losing their hard-earned money to dubious Saccos. Therefore, you need to be very careful before joining any Sacco. \n",
    "\n",
    "SACCOs helps members pull money together by making monthly contributions. Members can then access loans at low interest rates and get dividends from the SACCO at the end of the financial year. \n",
    "\n",
    "A friend of mine who has worked for Kenya Airways for 10 years was initially struggling to save money to buy a plot. After being initiated into Wanandege SACCO, he saved Ksh.200,000 for two years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later, was given a loan of Ksh.700,000. He used the loan to buy a plot in Kamulu and is now building a house. What was amazing is that the loan was attracting interest rate of 1% per month, which is so insignificant as compared to interest rates charged by local banks. Soon, he will be a proud owner of a home in Nairobi.\n",
    "\n",
    "SACCOS also buy land and sell it cheaply to their members. This is one thing that makes many Kenyans proud. You might get a SACCO selling a plot in Kitengela to its members at Ksh.150,000 and if you move 10 meters from the location, you will be shocked to find an individual selling a plot similar to the one owned by the SACCO at Ksh.500,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2019, one of my friends joined a SACCO in Nairobi. He started buying shares worth Ksh.5,000 every month. Today, he has shares worth over Ksh.300,000 in the SACCO. \n",
    "\n",
    "He is a happy man because each year he is assured of Christmas from the SACCO in terms of dividends. Unlike banks where shares trade at prices which ordinary Kenyan is unable to buy, shares from SACCOs are always affordable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s very hard for Kenyan SACCOs to make losses. Once you have your money in a SACCO, you are assured that it’s safe and chances of making losses are minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have witnessed several banks closing down because of being declared insolvent, but never have I witnessed a SACCO in Kenya going through receivership or failing to meet members’ targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "SACCOS like Ushuru, Stima and Harambee have grown so big that they are threatening the existence of banks in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "*SACCOs are important because:*\n",
    "\n",
    "They encourage you to save - SACCOs require you to save consistently and this, in turn, enables you to cultivate the discipline of saving frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are a sure investment - SACCOs pay out dividends on the savings of their members. Compared to other investments, saving in a SACCO has a more guaranteed return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emergency loans - Some SACCOs offer developmental and school fees loans that can be processed within a day, depending on the borrower’s urgency.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should join a SACCO because it will come in handy when you need to get a line of credit. Most importantly, when you do need this line of credit, you will have access to some of the lowest interest rates in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest rates charged by SACCOs are usually not subject to change. In fact, a majority of SACCOs lend at 12% annually, which is below anything banks have charged even when base rates were at their lowest. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not wait for tomorrow, save now and try to save as much as you can in a SACCO. The benefits you will reap later in life are worth the effort it will take you today.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Potato farming is one of those businesses that can either make or break you. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can get good returns provided you are willing to learn how to navigate your way up or you can literary “burn” your whole investment in less than 3 months. \n",
    "\n",
    "Read the next few paragraphs to find out the truth about this age-old business idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Potato Farming In Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "Potatoes are highland crops and they grow well in most major parts of the nation including Molo, Kinangop, Taita Hills, Yatta, Timboroa and parts of Laikipia.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Getting Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to find land in one of the high production areas. If you live in Nairobi area then you can think of going to places like Kinangop or North Nyandarua (an hour’s drive from the City). \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you don’t have to be a land owner to get started as you can simply lease. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the cost of leasing a good chunk of land in Nyandarua about 1 Kilometre from the tarmac is Ksh.15,000 to Ksh.25,000 per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tips For Picking Land For Potatoes*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Should not be too far from tarmac (1-2Km recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Look for one with reddish soil (toney)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Avoid land with a bad history of potato production\n",
    "\n",
    "*Avoid land that lies adjacent to a river to minimize chances of frost bite\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Prepare The Land*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have found a nice piece of land, the next step is to till it and prepare furrows ready for planting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here again you don’t have to do all the work yourself. You only need to hire a few village labourers and delegate the job to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re too busy with your current job or business, you can pick one of your idle uncles from the village and hire them as the farm manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to do is to get some manure. Manure is normally sold in lorries (mostly from Masai land) and a good load goes for Ksh.20,000 delivered to your place.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Buy Certified Seeds*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be tempted to take a short-cut by buying seeds from other farmers but you should know that this is the biggest mistake that most farmers make. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to get the best harvest, then you have to get the best disease-free seeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good source of these seeds is The Kisima Foundation…this is an organization that allows you to even pay by Mpesa and they deliver right outside your farm. The average cost of a bag of certified potato seeds is between Ksh.3,000 to Ksh.5,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tips For Buying Seeds*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Only buy certified seeds\n",
    "\n",
    "*Talk to local farmers about which breeds do well in the area around your farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples of potato breeds are Tigoni, Kenya Mpya, Asante and Shangi\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4: Plant and Wait For 90 Days*\n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing with potatoes is that they only take 90 days to mature. But in order for that to happen (and in order for the yield to be profitable) you need to ensure that your crop is well watered either through rain or irrigation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, be sure to apply DAP fertilizer in combination with manure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take care of the farm by weeding it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you will need to invest in chemicals and yield boosters – and these you can buy from the agrovet shops.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tips For Buying Chemicals*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Go for nematicides if you notice small wounds on potato roots\n",
    "\n",
    "*Go for fungicides in case of signs of blight\n",
    "\n",
    "Now from this point we can start talking business…\n",
    "\n",
    "*How To Get The Best Prices*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one thing to plant potatoes; selling them and getting the best prices is another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let me tell you something… in the potato world, there exists some sharp individuals called brokers.\n",
    "\n",
    "They come with lorries and move from door to door buying farm produce at some punitive prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing with brokers is that they save the farmer the hassle of finding the market, but the bad thing is that the prices they give are sometimes unsustainable and that explains why many first-time potato farmers “burn”.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what’s the secret to dealing with brokers? \n",
    "\n",
    "The first strategy is to plant your crop at around December so that you harvest it at around February or March when there is short supply and prices are favorable. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, right now as we write this a bag of potatoes is going for Ksh.4,000 and above. However, the same bag of potato may fluctuate to as low as Ksh.1,000 during the surplus season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another strategy is that some government and non-goverment institutions are now building special granaries where you can keep your potatoes until the market stabilizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can take your produce there and hold until the ripple effects of a bumper harvest subside.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you don’t want to wait or play with the seasons? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you can’t beat them join them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the many sales and marketing skills we equip you with in our PROFITABLE BUSINESS IDEAS WhatsApp group, there is absolutely no reason why you should not look for your own market of potatoes. \n",
    "\n",
    "You simply need to approach fast-food chains, restaurants, schools, institutions etc and give them a good quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then hire a mguu kumi or mguu sita lorry and go back to the village where in addition to collecting your own produce you can link up with other farmers to fill up the lorry. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way, you will be in a position to dictate the price and you will be able to get better returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, you will require about Ksh.80,000 for an acre of potatoes (from planting to harvesting).\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "The current market price for a sack of Shangi potatoes is Ksh.4,000. An acre of land can produce 80 bags of potatoes in 3 months. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s do the math.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ksh.4,000 x 80 bags = Ksh.320,000 (Revenue)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ksh.320,000 (Revenue) – Ksh.80,000 (Expenses) = Ksh.240,000 (Net Profit) in just 90 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "Potato farming is a good venture. It is not a get-rich-quick scheme (though) and majority of first time investors may lose their money due to obvious mistakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a positive note, if you have read this article to the end you can now proceed to make an investment confident of making returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "All it takes is a bit of discipline, hardwork and strategy.\n",
    "\n",

    "Today, Microsoft is the largest IT company in the world and chances are that you are reading this article on a computer or phone system that has been made by this great company. \n",

    "Mr. Gates is currently the second wealthiest individual in the world. You would certainly love to know what the world’s most successful entrepreneur has to say about making decisions, running a business, investing and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Lessons 1: On personal growth*\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is good to celebrate success, Bill cautions people not to allow themselves to get caught up in their success. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not think that just because you have landed your dream job that you can relax and stay at the top. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not think that just because things are going well now that you can take a back seat as you enjoy the ride to the top. Be wary of an enemy called “average”, don’t get stuck in a comfort zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Listen to what Bill has to say:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Be wary of success. Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose”\n",
    "\n",
    "*Lesson 2: On starting a business and making sales*\n",

    "In other words, the most difficult part of running a business isn’t opening up a big shop in the streets. It is providing a great solution to an actual problem…and that’s what Microsoft does with each and every piece of technology they launch. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you can think of coming up with a business that solves an existing societal problem, then the job of growing it will be relatively simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "And Bill Gates sums it up very well:\n",
    "\n",
    "“If you show people the problems and you show them the solutions, they will be moved to act.”\n",
    "\n",
    "*Lesson 3: On making decisions*\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s no need to make the same decision twice. So before you actually make a decision, be sure to take a broader look at it. \n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t want to be wasting time going back and forth retracting some of your original decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be decisive – and once you make a decision be ready to be bound by the consequences of its outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to bill, If you’re not firmly decisive, it interferes with your execution and capacity to grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in his own words, Bill says:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Going back and forth on decisions you have made not only interferes with your execution, but also your motivation to believe in your intuition in the first place.”\n",
    "\n",
    "*Lesson 4: On mistakes and failure*\n",
    "\n",
    "While Gates remains one of the most successful entrepreneurs on the globe, he has made his fair share of mistakes in the recent past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, he believes those mistakes were vital to making him the successful man he is today.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his own words, the guru says:\n",
    "\n",
    "“It is fine to celebrate success, but it is even more important to heed the lessons of failure”.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if you make a mistake, don’t dwell on it, learn from it but keep your eyes on the prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Lesson 5:On handling customers*\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, Bill has made many of his customers unhappy. Anyone who has seen their laptop crash understands this. \n",
    "\n",
    "But as much as people love to complain about Ms Windows, they continue to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since 1990, Microsoft Windows has been the world’s primary operating system and today 82.5% of computer users in the world use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is plain simple: Microsoft continues to act on customer feedback to improve their products…and the attitude starts with Bill Gates himself who was once quoted saying:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.”\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "Bill Gates’ career has been highlighted by his incredible vision. Microsoft remains a top company in the world largely because they always look one step ahead, to the next revolutionary idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "And herein lies the most precious lesson that we can borrow as entrepreneurs – if you want to get ahead in business, think ahead.\n",

    "\n",
    "One harsh reality of life is that long introductions to an article like this one can be boring at times, so it's important we take you straight to the point. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the 7 harsh realities of life. They come with losses, lessons and triumphs. They come after doubts and exploring the unknowns. So brace yourself…\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Not everyone who criticizes you is a hater*\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you recall the story of the naked emperor who was reminded of his nudity by a young boy while adult villages were falsely applauding his “sense of fashion”?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well the story goes like this… A long long time ago, a famous King went to the tailor to get some new clothes. And the tailor, not a genuine friend of the King, convinced him that he made anwonderful “invisible” suits and that the King would look wonderful in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the King walked out of the designer store wearing the “invisible suit” and marched to the town-square to meet the townspeople.\n",
    "\n",
    "The townspeople noticed he was naked but because they feared to disappoint him they opted to cheer him on telling him “You look wonderful our beloved king”. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there was a young orphaned boy in the crowd who felt that the King had been being misled and so he decided to take the risk of telling him truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the boy called out “But the King has no clothes!” And then suddenly everyone came to their senses and the King realized that all those around him were sycophants except for this bold young boy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long story short, the boy was adopted by the King and he later inherited power. The tailor was immediately handcuffed and taken to the village guillotine and buried that same day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The story teaches us that sometimes it takes that one person with guts to speak the truth and bring you back to your senses. \n",
    "\n",
    "So don’t treat everyone who criticizes as a hater. May be he is the only one with the guts to tell you that you are walking around naked.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Most of your current friends are FAKE FRIENDS*\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is that most of your buddies hangout with you because they see some value that they can inherit from you. They are parasites disguised as friends and they will leave you the moment your influence diminishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recent newspaper article, former ICT Permanent Secretary Mr. Bitange Ndemo narrated how his friends started avoiding him after he stopped working for the government.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, a onetime top journalist in Kenya media-space who became paralyzed following a car accident recently talked about how his former colleagues ignore his calls thinking that he is calling to ask them for help!\n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s face it. 90% of your current friends are like the mythical hyenas that follow you hoping your hand will fall off so that they can feast. Wake up and smell the coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. There is no unconditional love in this world except your mother’s love*\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider any situation, such as you got less marks in an exam. Your father will not talk to you. Your siblings might get disappointed in you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or even consider a situation when you die young. Your wife will leave you and get married to another man and your hubby will get himself a more beautiful replacement of you. But a mother’s love never fades. She will take care of you even when you are deep down inside your grave.\n",
    "\n",
    "So keep all those people who matter close but your mum even closer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. The older you get, the sicker you get*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your body is just like a car. The moment the odometer reads 150,000 Kilometers you know it’s time for frequent visits to a mechanic. By the time the reading becomes 300,000 Kilometers you know it’s time to either sell the car or ground it.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the same thing with life. By the time middle age rolls around, the worries of life gradually take a toll on you and your body parts increasingly become prone to pains, breaks, aches and sometimes complete failure. \n",
    "\n",
    "To keep going, you have to slow down and take better care of yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you are in your 20s, know it is the time to charge forward with the highest speed possible. Invest and diversity your portfolio while the sun shines.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you grow older and older you will realize that you will start to spend more time with your doctor than with your business accomplices. At that time it will be difficult to do some of the things you do with ease today.\n",
    "\n",
    "So take advantage of the moment and live life to the fullest.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Life becomes more user-friendly when you become more aware of what it means to be alive*\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all realities of life are harsh. Life is actually awesome on so many levels. It takes you up, it takes you down and everywhere in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you remember a long time ago how we used to worry about the giants of the forest and that they would come to devour us in the middle of the night? \n",
    "\n",
    "We were young, stupid and clueless and that’s why we believed that giants actually existed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as we matured, we came to realize that it was actually a HOAX and that the so called giants have never shown up on the surface of the earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember you are still maturing. Some of the things you worry so much about in your 20s or 30s will actually seem irrelevant 20 years down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "So discover your purpose, work towards it and forget about the GIANTS in your life for they are actually IMAGINARY.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Your salary will never be enough*\n",
    "\n",
    "Lift your two hands and sing “I surrender” if you are underpaid. No, just stop it. The reality of life is that even your CEO thinks he can do better with a few more zeroes on his salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend Karanja thinks his life would be better if his salary was paid twice a month (at date 1 and date 15 of every month) so he does not run broke midway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, irrespective of the way you look at it, a fixed monthly salary will never be enough. This is especially so if you spend more on sustaining high standards instead of saving and investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s not waste our time discussing how small your salary is, just accept the reality and move on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "and lastly…\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. There’s 100% chance you are going to die one day*\n",
    "\n",
    "Accepting you are going to die anyway is the best way to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose in life. Given this reality, why do you still insist on holding onto that bad job that is taking you nowhere?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are you sticking to that abusive relationship? Why play safe, gain nothing and die while you can follow your passion and die with dignity?\n",
    "\n",
    "You did not come to this world to work, pay your bills and die. The sooner you realize your purpose in life and start working towards it (risking all you have for it), the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is amazing what a human being can do once he or she begins to believe in himself or herself. If you don’t set a limit on your capabilities, there is really nothing that can stands in your way of greatness.\n",
    "\n",
    "So learn from this 7 realities of life and make the best out of every moment of your existence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Business Plan Writing. We only have 3 days remaining.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every human being is born with a unique and special contribution to the world. The sad reality is, less than one percent of humanity is confident enough to find and exploit their natural potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, I have found that everyone has some skill or knowledge that can be turned into a business. The interesting thing about this principle is that you don’t need to be the best at anything to succeed in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of people make the mistake of thinking they have to be the best at something before they can make money out of it. Not true. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a reality check: \n",
    "\n",
    "The most gifted people in almost every field are usually too SCARED, and can hardly muster the guts to start a business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered why most of the people who really start businesses in Africa don’t have MBAs and PhDs? \n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, I believe the more a person knows about a subject, the greater the fear they have to take risks. I call it the ‘curse of knowledge.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is, you don’t need to have the largest fountain of knowledge to use it to your advantage. What you actually need is confidence to apply the knowledge that you have (or can learn). Unfortunately, most people do the reverse; they spend all their life acquiring more knowledge that they will never use. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, knowledge is overrated. What we need is passion, creativity and courage to exploit the knowledge and skills we currently have. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linda Ikeji isn’t the best writer in Nigeria, by any means. Yet, her blog is one of the most successful in Africa, earning her thousands of dollars in income every month. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linda is not a trained journalist, but millions of Nigerians depend on her blog for a daily dose of breaking news and society gossip. \n",
    "\n",
    "By applying some creativity, she has successfully transformed her keen interest and passion into a viable business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Faustina Sakyi, the highly successful Ghanaian cassava farmer is not by any means the most skilled cassava producer in her country. She doesn’t even have a university degree. \n",
    "\n",
    "But by applying some basic knowledge and experience in farming, she has transformed her small cassava and gari products into a multinational export commodity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just by applying ‘common sense’, this woman was able to earn enough money to rise out of poverty. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bimbo Balogun was a novice at making African bead jewelry and was only ‘passing time’ with the art until she discovered by accident how lucrative a venture it was. Today, her bead jewelry is worn by celebrities and public figures in her country. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing is clear from the stories of these entrepreneurs: they are hardly masters or experts at what they do. Their successes prove that determination, passion and a will to take action with what you already have may just be all it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. \n",
    "\n",
    "Are your natural abilities in cooking, writing, organizing, farming or influencing people? Do you have a basic but specific knowledge of a trade, product or market? \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you don’t have the knowledge or skills, but have a strong interest and passion for it, you can learn it. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several free platforms on the internet e.g youtube where Africans can learn anything for free these days.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should take out a sheet of paper and list all the things you know and can do quite well. Remember, you don’t have to be the best at any of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, I have found that most of the things on your list are likely to be things you’ve known all your life, and can do almost effortlessly, but you have always taken them for granted. People may have often praised these abilities but you never gave too much thought to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think deep, they can’t be that far away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Business Plan Writing. We only have 3 days remaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business plan writing is a very important part of every business venture and that is why you hear about it very often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, most people who think about starting a business usually don`t consider writing a business plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it that most people have fear (so to say) about writing a business plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, there are many myths and lies you probably have heard about the subject of business plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some people present business plan as if it was a university thesis or an academic report to be defended before certain professors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other people think that a business plan has to be 50 pages long and that it must be written in a certain “approved” format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I am here to tell you that all those opinions are not valid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are some ugly lies around this important business step, most people are “afraid” of doing it.\n",

    "\n",
    "‘The customer is the King.’\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement is very true, considering that no business can survive without customers. If you have a product or service that no customer is willing to pay for, you don’t have a business. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, this statement isn’t just a ‘feel-good’ slogan. It’s actually true; without customers, you would go out of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes, we encounter customers who act like they were sent straight from hell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Difficult customers can leave you angry, worked up, frustrated and empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the way you handle difficult customers often defines the quality of your customer service. Not knowing how to deal with difficult customers may lead to low staff morale, lost sales, and a damaged reputation for your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I will share with you a real-life experience that got me thinking about difficult customers and ultimately influenced me to write this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will also be sharing with you the five major types of difficult customer personalities and how you can successfully serve them, and avoid a potentially ugly situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s dig in!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Three hours at the bank*\n",
    "\n",
    "It was supposed to be a very simple transaction. I walked into the bank sometimes back on a Monday to deposit cash into my account with a local bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to my expectation, the banking hall was packed full of people that morning. The queue was very long and I knew it was going to be a long wait, probably forty-five minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Little did I know there was a high-energy drama in the works.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had taken my place in the queue and was waiting my turn when I heard a loud voice erupt from behind me.\n",
    "\n",
    "‘What rubb-i-sh is this?’\n",
    "\n",
    "‘What sort of stupid bank is this?’\n",
    "\n",
    "‘I have been waiting here for more than thirty minutes now, and this shouldn’t be happening.’\n",
    "\n",
    "‘I need to see the manager right now!’, she said, at the very top of her voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "I couldn’t help but wonder at the petite lady who now had the full attention of the busy banking hall. \n",
    "\n",
    "She seemed quite normal, and I couldn’t understand why she thought she was more important, or had more urgent things to do than the rest of us who were waiting patiently in line.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the bank officials reached out to her to whisper something in her ear, in an attempt to calm her down, but the lady would have none of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "‘I want to see the manager right now!’, she continued to scream.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was getting very embarrassing and all the bank tellers had stopped working. All eyes were firmly set on the drama that was unravelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "My hurry, all of a sudden, had disappeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "By this time, the lady had walked up to the counter and insisted on getting served, over the rest of us. Of course, this made the whole situation messier as more people joined the shouting match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long story short, I stormed out of the bank three hours later. I couldn’t believe I had lost my entire Monday morning to the impatience and arrogance of one difficult customer. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was a very frustrating experience for me, and more so for other customers and the bank officials.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was this ugly experience that inspired my decision to research ‘difficult customers’ and how to handle them. And I’m about to share my findings with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The 5 Major Types of Difficult Customers and How To Handle Them*\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to dealing with difficult customers is to first understand what type of difficult customer they are and then to use the right approach to handle them. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the right approach, even the most frustrating customer can be served with a minimal amount of stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s meet our difficult customers!\n",
    "\n",
    "*1) The Bully*\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of difficult customer is quick to anger, very aggressive, highly critical, impatient, rude, arrogant and often verbally abusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bullies think their needs and demands are superior to everybody else’s. It’s not a surprise they don’t like to wait. They want to be served NOW!\n",
    "\n",
    "The bully, whether male or female, uses intimidation tactics to get what they want. They scream, complain, abuse and may often get physical to get what they want.\n",
    "\n",
    "That petite lady in the bank is one clear example of a bully. She tried to use her voice and aggression to get her way over others. She believed her needs were to be prioritized over the others, even those ahead of her in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to handle the Bully*\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn’t really matter whether you are right or wrong, bullies don’t care about your explanations. If you have any, please save it for your other customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bully’s impatient, rude and arrogant attitude makes it almost impossible for them to listen to any other voice other than theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the best way to handle a bully, especially when he’s the one on the wrong side, is to calmly and confidently apologise for the ‘problem’ and tell him you’re willing to solve the problem if he calms down and tells you exactly how you can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always maintain eye contact with the bully at all times. It shows him you’re not giving in to his antics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t ever join a bully in a shouting match or try to match her aggression. Respond politely to them without raising your voice and never take their insults and criticisms personally. It’s your responsibility to remain calm and ‘sane’ while the bully is still in a fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If in the end, your attempts to handle him fail, cut him off. Some customers, especially bullies, are just bad for business. They don’t deserve your service.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if the bully is a high value customer, you can reach out to him at another time, when she may have cooled off.\n",
    "\n",
    "‘Converted bullies’ can become very loyal customers and ambassadors of your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2) Mr. Know-it-all*\n",
    "\n",
    "I am sure you have met this kind of person before. They seem to know everything about everything, including your business, product or service.\n",
    "In their bid to showcase their knowledge, they could be highly critical and rude. They also tend to talk a lot and always want to dominate the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of customer can be especially difficult to deal with because you can’t really tell what they want. In fact, sometimes, this attitude could just be a negotiation gambit intended to make your product or service seem inferior so that they can get it at a cheaper price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t fall for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Know-it-alls like the sound of their own voice and love to be the centre of attention. They have an ego problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to handle the Know-it-all*\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling this type of difficult customer can be easy, if you know how to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Know-it-alls repond quite well to an ego massage. Compliment their knowledge of your product or service and give them some good attention while you can. Make sure your compliments are sincere and not patronizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Never argue with this type of customer as you will end up having an extended argument. And worse still, you may hurt her ego.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, if you need to correct him and provide some facts and information, you may use a line like: ‘You’re right, but I think the product is… (make your point).\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the ‘Know-it-all’ feels she got your attention, and leaves with her ego intact, this kind of customer can become loyal too.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3) The Habitual Complainer*\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, customers complain. And it’s a good thing because complaints can be a very rich source of positive and constructive feedback for your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when you find a particular customer who complains all the time – even about the pettiest of things – you may have a habitual complainer on your hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "These customers complain about everything and anything. They nag about your prices, the layout of your office, the colour of your shirt, and even the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this type, nothing is ever good enough. That’s why it can be almost impossible to totally satisfy them.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to handle the Habitual Complainer*\n",
    "\n",
    "While his complaints may seem harmless, you need to be careful with the habitual complainer because his attitude can exhaust you and totally stress you out.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to come to terms with the fact that you cannot satisfy everybody. And the habitual complainer is one of those. Accepting this fact will help you limit yourself from going out of your way to satisfy him everytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "All you can do is give your very best.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this doesn’t mean you should ignore the habitual complainer. Give her your attention and let her know you’re listening. Never give in to the temptation to make excuses or explain your way out of her complaints.\n",
    "No matter what she says, respond calmly and nicely, and with a smile (if you can find one.) \n",
    "\n",
    "If there are any valid complaints you think you can fix, then do something about it. It’s always a good strategy to make a note of all the things he’s asking for and serve him at once. That way, you don’t have to deal with him multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4) Madam ‘No Boundaries’*\n",
    "\n",
    "I used to have a client who would call me on a Sunday morning to discuss a matter that’s neither very important nor urgent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of customer doesn’t respect boundaries and expects you to respond to her requests immediately. It doesn’t matter if it’s 3a.m in the morning or over the weekend. She will send you emails, texts and would even give you a call at the oddest times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Madam ‘No Boundaries’ is the type of customer that invades your personal life and leaves you feeling swarmed and overwhelmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to handle the ‘No Boundaries’*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you suspect that a customer falls into this category, it’s usually best to clearly explain your boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could clearly state in your contract, emails or signs in your business: ‘We are open from 8am to 6pm, on Mondays to Fridays. If something comes up over the weekend, unless it’s an emergency, we will respond on Monday morning.’\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times, this type of customer may ignore the stated boundaries and still send you an email over the weekend. When this happens, enforce the boundaries by your behaviour instead of direct confrontation – only respond to that email by Monday morning!\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, with this type of client, it’s always good to set expectations. If not, they will swarm you with requests from all corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5) The Indecisive*\n",
    "\n",
    "For some strange reason, this type of customer just cannot make a decision. They will ask you questions, and even more questions, but still can’t make a purchase no matter the quantity of information you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indecisives want to be 101 percent sure that they are getting the best deal, quality, price and features before they buy. They are usually afraid of making any mistakes. That’s why they keep asking questions, comparing, and ‘investigating.’\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of customer is the classic time waster. They will exhaust your energy and time, and still won’t buy. Although they are harmless and often very polite, this type of customer can be very draining on your productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to handle the Indecisive*\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to handling the Indecisive is to determine their hot button. What exactly are they most concerned about? Price? Quality? Quantity? Features?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you know what their hot button is, it’s much easier to ‘force’ them to make a decision. If they make the decision, good for you – you will make a sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if they don’t make the decision, you can just ignore them for the time wasters that they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to move Indecisives towards a decision is to ‘sweeten’ the deal. Give them a price or bulk discount, a free taster, or offer a money-back guarantee. Better still, you can introduce some urgency to ‘help’ them make a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, you need to be strict with this type of customer. If not, they will eat up your time and energy, and leave you exhausted – without a sale, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Have you had any experiences dealing with difficult customers?*\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as you are in business, you will surely encounter difficult customers from time to time. They will always be there. Your job is to handle them successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, most customers are reasonable, trouble-free and straight-to-the-point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always remember that your ability to successfully handle difficult customers will lead to greater respect for your business, more patronage, higher sales and healthy staff morale.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not enough to put the blame on the difficult customers. By applying the techniques in this article, you can adapt to their tactics and hopefully, convert them to friendly and loyal customers.\n",
    "\n",

    "26/03/2022, 12:35 pm - +254 701 711058: *HOME-BASED BUSINESSES YOU CAN START*\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandemic has changed attitudes about the nature of work, and now, more than ever, many realise that working from home is indeed possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "With high-speed internet and proliferation of devices, making money from home is now a reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few business ideas you can consider: \n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Food business*\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes a food business viable is the fact that people will always eat. It is a basic need, meaning customers will always be there regardless of any other external factors. If you have a passion for cooking and baking, this is the job for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a bakery: “How to start a cake baking business from home” was the most searched question in Facebook groups in Kenya towards the end of 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya has a huge appetite for baked food and you can never go wrong with this one of the oldest industries. You do not have to start with all the equipment, start small and keep ploughing back the returns until you build on to a large investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fruit vending is another great option. All you need is fruits, a blender, a knife, and willingness to work. Shop for your fruits from the cheapest markets in your area.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can cook good food, catering is yet another viable opportunity. Cook local meals like githeri, beans, pilau, chapati and mandazi and find the bachelors in your estate to sell to. \n",
    "\n",
    "For as much as Sh.200 a meal, you can grow gradually into a catering business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Crafts*\n",
    "\n",
    "A craft is anything skillfully made by hand. If you have the skills, you can make ornaments of different types like glass, wood or beads, and shells.\n",
    " \n",
    "A twist to it would be to make African pieces or jewelry with a personalised message. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, import bracelets, necklaces, earrings and resell online.\n",
    " \n",
    "Paper jewelry making, candle making and gift basket making are other lucrative crafts that only require creativity and as little capital as Sh.3,000 for materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crafts could also include soap-making. With just Sh.1,500 you can get a 100 per cent profit for 20 litres of home-made soap. You can easily learn this craft on YouTube.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Freelance writing*\n",
    "\n",
    "The gig-economy has received a bad rap in the past and received little to no serious attention, but you can actually make a career out of it. Realise that everything needs writing. All businesses need things written. \n",
    "\n",
    "They need newsletters. Copy for brochures, memos and press releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Freelancing platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer, goLance, 99designs, and many others are connecting people in need of the service and service providers who are the online freelancers. \n",
    "\n",
    "And that makes them a perfect starting point for every newbie. \n",
    "\n",
    "If well done, you can earn over Sh.5,000 per 500 words in Upwork. This is a bidding site so you first need to make sure you complete your profile then submit it for approval. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once approved, you will be able to send proposals or apply for jobs on the site. Make sure you really understand the art of sending winning proposals. Read a lot about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic writing, copy-writing, transcription and captioning are in huge demand in freelance work. Once you get the job, be sure to ask for half the money up front as some clients may take you for a ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Create a YouTube channel*\n",
    "\n",
    "‘How to Cook Perfect Hard-Boiled Eggs’ has 2.5 million views on YouTube and it is not even close to the most viewed egg video on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot afford to ignore the huge opportunity available in YouTube, especially in Kenya. The market is still widely untapped and even when saturated, there is space for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are passionate about something like video games or makeup, you can share your passion with the world while you make money.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is estimated that 44 per cent of internet users are interested and watch video blogs (vlogs) every month. That is half of all internet users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only challenge is creating content that interests your target audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are limitless video ideas like prank videos, comedy videos, kitchen recipes, how-to-do videos, travel tips, or anything you think is useful for people, even boiling an egg.\n",
    "\n",
    "As your views and subscribers grow, so do your earnings. Reaching at least 1,000 subscribers already entitles you to have advertisements placed and with these ads, you get paid. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a laptop, high-speed internet and a camera phone you can start as soon as now.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Forex trading*\n",
    "\n",
    " Forex trading is a very lucrative way to make money for those who have a good knowledge of the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "For beginners, forex may seem very complex, especially when you listen to mentors who make a living out of their phony advice and never on the Forex itself but in reality it’s pretty simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start trading, you should first open up a practice account and gain experience as well as knowledge by reading. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of free or paid courses available on the internet that can train you for online trading like the BabyPips school to learn basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have learned the basics, open a demo account, download MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and start trading with virtual money. \n",
    "\n",
    "MT4 is the most popular trading software but there are many others a google search away. Spend at least two weeks doing demo trade and learning the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, be critical of who you learn from, as some courses teach methods that do not work and in the long run you may lose money.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better route to forex is learning financial analysis, about currencies and all of the variables that can impact them Macro, Technical, Politics, and many more, as this is what will drive the currency prices resulting in the profits and losses for you as a trader.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you search LogikFx on YouTube you will learn how to do analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that forex trading is not something to learn in a month or two. Be sure you are ready to commit months’ worth of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final thoughts*\n",
    "\n",
    "Business opportunities are emerging every day in Kenya with many employing the use of the internet to make money.\n",
    "\n",

    "26/03/2022, 5:12 pm - +254 742 304047: *ARE YOU PROFITING FROM YOUR TALENT?*\n",
    "\n",
    "So many people around you talk about talent, especially when they see someone who becomes extremely rich as a result of his/her talents.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's common to hear, “That musician is very talented. Look at how he/she sings easily”\n",
    "\n",
    "You can hear people saying, “Football is very easy for Ronaldo.”\n",
    "\n",
    "How true? Do talents truly give people easy success?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes and no, depending on what you call “easy success”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Talents are like gold. Talents are great and can make you rich, yet, talents (like gold) require much work before they become an “ATM machine”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I continue, let me share with you this good quotation:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Talent is cheaper than table salt. What separates the talented individuals from the successful ones is a lot of hard work.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Wow! Read that quotation again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Talent is cheaper than table salt, everybody has one. The only thing that turns talent into great success is work… a lot of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for instance, Michael Jackson was recognized as (probably) the most famous musician ever in the history of the world. In his time, whenever Jackson released a musical album he could sell one million copies in 12 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was rich, famous and influential… all because of his musical talents.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that is just the public part of that story. Let me tell you the private side… Jackson practiced 8hrs every day to arrive at that level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anybody else could or can be having a better talent than Michael Jackson, but if that person doesnt put in work, a lot of work, he/she will never become rich or famous with the talent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We all know that Michael Jordan is very talented. But do you know about his secret hard work? Lets read what he said:\n",
    "\n",
    "“I have always believed that if you put in the work, the results will come” Michael Jordan\n",
    "\n",
    "Though he is a great basketball player, though he has talent, work (hard work) is what made him a great success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about Tiger Wood, Okocha, Eto, or any great writer, singer, artist or even business man (yes, business men use their talents to succeed too), you will find out that, though they may have talents, only hard work, concentrated efforts, commitment, focus and stubbornness (call it persistence) are the virtues that make them successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Where am I going precisely? Why am I writing this article?*\n",
    "\n",
    "There is this great misconception about what talent is and how it makes people rich. Many people, whenever they see a successful person, ignorantly attribute his/her success to talent.\n",
    "\n",
    "While they may be right, they usually forget three facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, they too have talents (as I said earlier, talent is common like table salt). The second fact I see that most people usually forget is that those who become rich and successful because of their talents do so only after a hell of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third mistake most people make is that they dont know that they have to discover their talents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me use again the analogy of gold (and other natural resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nigeria is today the sixth largest oil producer in the world. We can boldly say that Nigeria is “talented” in oil. But you know oil was not discovered in Nigeria to be a great wealth until around 1958.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ghana is “talented” in gold. But if nobody dared to search, look for and find gold in the nation of Ghana, Ghana would never have known anything to be called gold.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is my message here?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most times, talent is not what you just wake up to see (obviously) in your palm. Talent is what you have to “search out”. Talent has to be discovered (just as gold or oil has to be discovered).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some countries in the world that are having certain natural resources and are yet to discover them. Just like we recently discovered that Kenya is talented with oil.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is that there are several millions of people in the world that are having great talents, but are yet to discover them (and may never discover them in their whole life time, because they don`t know that they have a duty to do so).\n",
    "\n",
    "*How do you discover your talents?*\n",
    "\n",
    "By paying attention to your heart. By observing your interests. By spending time with your passion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain all these.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to pay attention to your heart. What makes it glad? What is that thing that gives your heart a great pleasure? What is that thing that when doing, time passes away so quickly and you never feel any burden of working?\n",
    "\n",
    "Search your heart (just as anyone searching for natural resources will) and look for some pleasant signals in relation to your daily tasks, hobbies or engagements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for instance, I am making money from being a writer and business consultant, even though I have invested in other businesses. But I never knew 10 years ago that I could make money through writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you know what? I have been writing since I was between age 13 and 15. I love writing. My primary and high school compositions and essays were perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "I never knew that writing could lead to anything. I was simply doing what I loved doing.\n",
    " \n",
    "This is where you have to be careful. I never listened to my heart until many years later. So many people will have talents and will never listen to their hearts, so they won't see those talents as things of great monetary value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, observe what interests you. Observe those things that interest you and see how you can commercialize them. Usually your talent will be like your hobby. You will love doing it and you will do it with more ease than most people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third thing you have to do is, spend time perfecting your talents.\n",
    "\n",
    "God doesn't give human beings finished products. He gives us raw materials. He gives us raw gold. We must refine it. He gives us raw oil. We must refine it. He gives us raw talents. We must refine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people dont know this truth. You better know now!\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to work (very hard) on your talent, if you will ever be successful with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to practice, practice and practice your talent. I write virtually every day, even if it means writing a short post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read good books about that line of your passion and other inspirational books that will encourage and inspire you. If you dont practice and study in the area of your talent (I mean practicing like crazy), you cannot refine it or commercialize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "My wife was a footballer, right from her very young age. She would leave home to play football with young boys. But her father hated seeing her play football.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You are not a boy. What do you have to do with football?” was her father`s usual discouragement.\n",
    "\n",
    "After fighting for what she loved doing for some time, she felt it was a tough battle she could not win and gave up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing left with her today is she walks smart (due to much exercise she had as a footballer). \n",
    " \n",
    "If for any reason you cannot work (hard) on your talent, forget it. You cannot become rich with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you discovered your talent? \n",
    "\n",
    "If yes, have you monetized it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, as you think about the above 2 questions, I would like to remind you that we only have 1 day remaining before we start our training on Business Plan Writing.\n",

    "27/03/2022, 6:42 pm - +254 742 304047: *WHY YOU ARE LOSING SO MANY CUSTOMERS NOWADAYS*\n",
    "\n",
    "Another year has come and gone and your sales aren’t improving. Your company hasn’t grown as fast as you had expected. Your market share is slowly weathering out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Could it be that your customers are neglecting you? Are you retaining your customers or losing them out to your competitors? \n",
    "\n",
    "There must be some reasons why customers are leaving you, so it is time to take active steps to understand what your customers expect to receive from you so that you can revise your strategy accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "*1. YOUR PRICE, SERVICE & PRODUCT ARE CHASING THEM AWAY*\n",
    " \n",
    "There are three major reasons why customers defect. These are Price, Service and Product. Customers are very sensitive to pricing and the moment the price is increased and they find a better price somewhere else, they defect. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, customers tend to be choosy about customer service and will defect at the slightest hint that your customer service is not meeting their expectation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A bad product is another major turnoff and will lead to customer dissatisfaction and desertion. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Tip*: You need to extra carefully analyze these three parameters (Price, Service and Product) and improve on points of weakness. \n",
    "\n",
    "*2. YOU ARE FOCUSING TOO MUCH ON MAKING MONEY AND FORGETTING YOUR CUSTOMER`S INTEREST*\n",
    "\n",
    "If your business focuses totally on customers and is truly customer centric, the question you live by would be – “What can I do for my customers?” \n",
    "\n",
    "You have to realize that customers are the sole reason why your business exists and brings you profits. But lots of businesses seem to ignore this fact by treating their customers like beggars. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the focus is on you and your company/business needs alone and you don’t bother to put customers first, at the heart of your business, you’re going to lose them one by one. \n",
    "\n",
    "*3. YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS POOR*\n",
    " \n",
    "Customers can be terribly upset with poor customer service and decide never to come to you again. The many hundreds of consumers who are switching to other stores, companies or business providers, due to poor customer service experiences is growing year by year. \n",
    "\n",
    "So customer service can never be ignored. In fact it is more important today than it ever was. You are in the age of the customer based era where the quality of your customer service in a sure determinant of whether customers will stay with you or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if it’s less than satisfactory, you have trouble brewing. \n",
    "\n",
    "*4. YOU DON’T KEEP YOUR PROMISES*\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping your promises is an important component in keeping your customers. Customers are intensely disappointed if you commit something to them and fail to deliver it. This may be one of the worst mistakes you can make in business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Never expect the customer to run around you, sorting out issues and trying to get what you assured them you would deliver in the first place. Stick to your promise and do not deviate, or you risk losing the customer for good. \n",
    "\n",
    "*5. YOU DON’T PAY ATTENTION TO NEGATIVE FEEDBACK*\n",
    " \n",
    "Perhaps the customer wants to be with you and is telling you something that will improve your services or product. Your customers are surely your best critics so why not listen to their feedback. \n",
    "\n",
    "When customers are unhappy with your product they will complain to you and if this falls on deaf ears, they will most certainly turn to your competitors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lost them didn’t you? All because you were not prepared to listen and take action. \n",
    "\n",
    "*6. YOU HAVEN’T GIVEN CUSTOMERS ANY REASON TO STAY WITH YOU*\n",
    " \n",
    "Your customers have been loyal and faithful to you and you took it for granted. You have never thought of rewarding them in some way which they would appreciate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t ignore their continued trust in you and give them that little extra which will make a huge difference to your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Special offers, discounts, you can think of so many ways to retain the loyal clientele. This way, you may attract new customers too. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain the fine balance and you will maintain a flourishing business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as I conclude this article, I would like to remind you to join our training on Business Plan Writing which will be starting tomorrow.\n",

    "\n",
    "Life is too short to be reinventing wheels! \n",
    "\n",
    "Copying a business idea that is already successful can be legal, if you do it intelligently.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you already know, Africa’s market is huge and there is more than enough room for new and existing businesses to satisfy the expanding consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copying an already successful product or service is one of the most popular and easiest means of starting your own business.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy is a huge part of how next-generation economies like China and India are building their fortunes. They intelligently copy great ideas and products from the developed world, and create their own cheaper versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ways this strategy works is simple: Find a business idea (product or service) that’s already successful and think of a way to make it better, cheaper, more convenient or more beautiful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you must be mindful not to steal or infringe on somebody’s copyright or patent. You could get sued!\n",
    "\n",
    "In my former neighborhood, there used to be a popular and very successful laundry and dry cleaning business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s call them ‘Wash Brothers’.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was the only laundry and dry cleaning service in the area and people didn’t really have any alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would often hear customers complain that their prices were expensive and the customer service, horrible. \n",
    "\n",
    "But because the next laundry shop was just too far away, everyone had to put up with Wash Brothers, which was apparently making a lot of money in spite of its poor and expensive services.\n",
    "\n",
    "It kind of crossed my mind a few times but I’m glad somebody else could see the opportunity in the market caused by Wash Brothers’ reckless monopoly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guess what happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another laundry and dry cleaning shop opened a few blocks away from Wash Brothers! Their prices were far more reasonable, and the customer service was just too excellent! \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, they totally beat Wash Brothers in their game, and it was evident they were stealing their customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new business stole the Wash Brothers’ idea, improved on it, and then stole all of Wash’s customers. And guess what, it’s all perfectly legal!\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‘copy’ principle works beyond your immediate neighbourhood. You can actually copy business concepts and ideas from foreign countries and introduce them to your locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there needs, problems or challenges you have noticed around you that already have solutions in other parts of the world? \n",
    "\n",
    "You will find clues when you travel, browse the internet or read the news.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just be very observant and you will be amazed by the opportunities you will find. And when you find them, copy intelligently and improve on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good businesses ideas to copy aren’t too hard to find in Africa. Because many markets on the continent are still virgin and competition is light, the few businesses which dare to exist are shining lights in their markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as Africa’s economies grow, more new businesses will enter our markets to compete.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn a lot from the existing products and services around you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you make them bigger, better, safer, cheaper, faster, more convenient or more beautiful?\n",

    "28/03/2022, 8:13 pm - +254 701 711058: *WINES AND SPIRITS BUSINESS IN KENYA*\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it easy to start a wines and spirit shop in Kenya? Well, the answer to that question depends on how one is prepared for the task. Before we talk about what is required to start let us first take an overview of the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a statement by NACADA, about 15 million Kenyans drink regularly. 12 million drink daily spending an average of Ksh.100 on each occasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2010 the Alcohol Drinks Control Act (commonly known as Muthutho Law) was passed to regulate operations in this industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market for wines and spirits in Kenya is growing because majority find them cheaper than beer whose price has been rising in recent years due to implementation of SIN TAX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sit-in customers spend an average of Ksh.300 per day while takeaway customers spend at least Ksh.210 per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wine and Spirits Business in Kenya is very popular. This business is especially popular in estates within urban centers where there’s a high population of people with disposable income. Coupled with the fact that a high number of people prefer to buy alcohol and drink at home (or house parties), the potential for wine and spirits business in Kenya will only keep growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening a liquor store can be a great way to ensure a steady income, because people drink alcohol in both good times and bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, retail alcohol sales are heavily regulated, and it can be difficult for an interested businessperson to know where to start. Nonetheless, with proper counsel and wise strategies to boost traffic, your store can be a reliable income stream for years to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is wines and spirit a good business in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Morality aside, a lot of Kenyans drink religiously meaning there are huge profits to be made in this business. And you can easily confirm this by peeping into the latest wines and spirits wholesale prices in Kenya and then comparing the prices that wholesalers give retailers and the average retail prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually according to my source, the minimum profit you can make per bottle is Khs.30 so do your math considering that you are dealing with fast moving goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wholesalers make more because they are able to move bigger volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What are the pros of the wines and spirit business in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest advantage is that you hardly lack customers. You see, the prices vary a lot and you’ll stock some cheaply priced liquors (make sure they’re KEBS certified) for common mwananchi as well as pricey whiskeys for the well-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if you’re in a strategic location, the constant flow of customers and good margins will soon give you financial freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What are the cons of the wines and spirit business in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several issues here:\n",
    "\n",
    "Morality: If you are a deeply religious person, the business may seem as like it goes against Christian ethos. Certainly, your pastor, Imam, or Father (priest) will not be impressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Licenses: To start a wines and spirits business, the government may take as much as Ksh.100,000 (more on this later) in licensing fees, an amount which is a bit steep for small traders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corruption: The high cost of wines and spirits license in Kenya prompts some people to corrupt police officers and regulatory authorities in an effort to ‘save’ which can be very costly in the long run. .. Police should not be a problem if you have the listed licenses, you are not selling liquor from the black market (make sure they’re KEBS certified) and you open at the specified time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating hours: You may be prosecuted if you operate your business outside the authorized hours as per your license.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the same, the profit margins make the business hugely attractive to thousands of enterprising Kenyans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like every other business, it may seem a bit hard at the start but once you pick, you will forget all the initial challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, it’s always better to start small. The capital injection will be lower plus you will have ample time to study what your customers like instead of locking capital in slow moving brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Find a suitable location*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this business, location is everything – unless of course you have some unique drinks that can’t be found elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, start by getting yourself an amazing site in a busy street/road/corridor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The room doesn’t have to be big for a start and some people start in premises smaller than 10×10 square feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of your liquor store is inextricably connected to its location. Identify an ideal location and because alcohol consumption is a leisure activity many clients prefer to frequent establishments that are easily accessible from the main road.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve identified what seems to be a suitable location, you need to make sure you can actually operate a liquor store there. Many localities will have restrictions on where alcohol can be sold—not in close proximity to a church, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid setting up your business near schools as this is against the law.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you open a liquor store in a market that’s already saturated, not only is your store unlikely to do well, but you’re likely to eat into a local competitor’s bottom line as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market saturation is heavily influenced by distance to competitors, but there are other factors at play. Another influential factor is the demographic and cultural makeup of the neighborhood itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The place you establish your brick-and-mortar shop can make all the difference in regards to a successful Wines and Spirits business in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "A remote location far outside of residential areas that’s hard to get to will not yield the same results as a desirable spot in the heart of a shopping center/estate; nor will the price tag be similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating spaces, be sure to properly consider all factors, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility, Cost, target market,Security, Any legal considerations – like Wines and Spirits should not be near Schools\n",
    "\n",
    "*Have a Plan*\n",
    "\n",
    "No business, no matter how great the underlying concept, can succeed without a plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before securing funding or renting a space or any other step required to get your liquor store off the ground, it’s important to have a business plan in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "This goes beyond the surface level details – “My business will be open seven days a week with an inventory focused on working class men and women” – in order to truly explain the whats, whens, wheres, whys, and hows of your entire operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, a business plan is both for your benefit and that of potential investors; banks, angel investors, and business partners will likely want to see your business plan before moving forward and financially backing your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong business plan makes you look trustworthy and intelligent which will help convince potential partners to work with you and financial partners to invest in your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Research the market*\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a solid approach to marketing, you will likely spend your first few months in the business working in a mostly empty store.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’ve established that you’ll be able to sell alcohol at your chosen location, you need to take steps toward crafting a business plan. The first of these is to research the market around your chosen location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquor stores are very much neighborhood stores. What sells in one neighborhood won’t necessarily sell in another. An influential factor is the demographic and cultural makeup of the neighborhood itself. The more detailed the market analysis in your business plan, the more detailed your cost estimates can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take factors like ethnicity, age, marital status, and income into account when you’re conducting your market analysis, because they all heavily influence drinking habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Create sales and cost projections*\n",
    "\n",
    "The market analysis is meant to give you a good idea of your customer base. With an idea of the composition of your customer base, you can create sales and cost projections based on buying habits and price points for items in your area.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a disproportionate amount of young single customers or university/college students in your area, you can anticipate selling large amounts of spirits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach wholesale distributors about their case prices and compare that expense with the local price point of popular brands. When that’s combined with traffic estimates and overhead (including rent and labor costs), you can estimate costs and sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t neglect the impact of competitors on your sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Obtain financing if necessary.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, a new business owner should use as little financing for a start-up as possible. This rule applies to liquor stores too, but since demand for alcohol is more or less fixed, many lenders will regard a liquor store as an unusually safe investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you have a large amount of money you plan to invest in your Wine and Spirits business, you will likely need to secure outside financing. For most entrepreneurs, this means a small business loan through a Bank or SACCO.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you approach the lender, bring your business plan and financial statements (including income, assets and liabilities, and tax documents) along with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although business plans are detailed documents, you will have already done the most important work, the market research and the revenue projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find out more about how to write a good business plan or hire a professional business plan writer to guide you.\n",
    "\n",
    "When starting off, ensure you determine exactly how much you will need to purchase stock, do interior fittings, pay for licenses, rent deposits etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "After covering all this costs, ensure you have some other funds at your disposal for any unforeseen circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to ensure you have enough funding to get started and cover any emerging matters during your first 3 months of operations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The Liquor Licensing Act in Kenya comprehensively explains the requirements that a business person ought to fulfil to obtain their permit. However, different regions have imposed further laws for the sale of alcohol, making it even harder to meet such stringent conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "What are the different types of liquor licenses in Kenya?\n",
    "\n",
    "Brewer’s license\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the license for the big boys, those firms that handle the processing part of any alcoholic drinks in Kenya. Of course, a brewer’s license is subject to certain conditions set by the Alcoholic Drinks Control Act.\n",

    "\n",
    "Wholesale license\n",

    "\n",
    "Before the liquor licensing board approves your application, there are specific parameters that you ought to meet. Even though licenses vary significantly and different counties have further regulations, you need to, at least, think about the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "What establishment are you? Will it be a bar, wines and spirits or a restaurant?\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the drinking or selling happen during the day, night or both?\n",
    "\n",
    "What hours are you planning to sell your alcoholic beverages? The later you stay open, the costlier the liquor license.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you interested in manufacturing, distributing and selling any type of alcoholic beverages?\n",
    "\n",
    "The application process\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinarily, these types of licenses are applied in person from the respective County Council Business Licensing offices.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start a wines and spirits business or any other alcohol selling business, you will have registered with the attorney general’s office.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, you ought to visit the licensing office after you have an official business or company name.\n",

    "Tilt your initial inventory toward items which will sell quickly—the more you sell, the cheaper the cost to you—and then broaden your inventory later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The price of alcohol is usually fixed by a distributor who has a monopoly on that particular brand (which is why the prices of alcohol are almost similar everywhere), so you’re unlikely to be able to negotiate much on the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Aim to Be a One Stop Shop Wines and Spirits Shops in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumers are accustomed to buying everything on their list in one place. As a Wines and Spirits Shop in Kenya, your customers will expect you to have (almost) everything they need for their event or party.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stocking disposable cups and ice will save your customers a stop while increasing your revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do your research by visiting wines and spirits shops near your area and ask workers how they get supplied the products, don’t ask the owners because he may be suspicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first develop a positive relationship with the workers by occasionally buying from them, once they are comfortable with you, they will tell you everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Furnish the room and stock your business*\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step is to furnish the room and bring the stock. You need nice chairs, shelves, tables etc. Furnishing the room will cost you up to Ksh.70,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retail Stocking will cost Ksh.50,000 to Ksh.200,000\n",
    "\n",
    "There are those who prefer wholesale business, In this case you need a capital in excess of Ksh.1.5 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Consider hiring an employee.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most liquor stores aren’t the types of businesses with absentee owners. The owners of liquor stores usually work in the store full time, especially in the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, hiring an employee or two might help you operate more efficiently than you would otherwise be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s an open secret that Wines and Spirits shop owners can lose considerable amounts of money from liquor theft when there are no preventive measures in place. The financial loss can cripple an establishment if the theft continues undetected over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dishonest shop attendants steal alcohol from the shop in various ways, such as taking alcohol from the shop, bringing in and selling their own alcohol, selling at wrong prices etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can prevent employee alcohol theft at your wines and spirits shop by adopting several preventive measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Check references and run a background check before hiring shop attendants.*\n",
    "\n",
    "A careful investigation can reveal dishonest candidates with a history of theft and alcoholism. This is helpful in creating a staff of dependable workers unlikely to steal liquor. Proper background research can help prevent employee alcohol theft at your shop\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Install surveillance cameras to completely monitor inside and outside the shop.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Shop attendants aware of being watched are less likely to steal.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Tell shop attendants about the various anti-theft policies.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the effects of theft and why you need to prevent employee theft at your wines and spirits shop. Also discuss the actions considered alcohol theft and explain the disciplinary measures taken for such actions. Give each worker an employee guide containing this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Always verify purchase, receipt and issuing of alcohol*\n",
    "\n",
    "A dishonest shop attendant can order more than is required and ensure the disparity doesn’t appear in the records.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Have a Main Store and Display Counter*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that new stock is first received into the main store then issued to the counter/display. Create a record-keeping system that requires the shop attendant to record every bottle of liquor removed from main storage so as to prevent employee alcohol theft at your bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Take a daily count of the alcohol inventory.*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also assign this task a different person or yourself. If a dishonest shop attendant is entrusted with this task, he can increase or decrease the count to hide theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Conduct regular spot checks at the shop to ensure the bottle count and liquor levels match sales.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Undertake random stock counts to determine check if physical stock levels agree with system stock\n",
    "\n",
    "*8. Ban shop attendant from drinking during a shift or in the establishment when they are off-duty.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a logical measure to ensure that the shop-attendant does not get tempted to drink and not pay for the alcohol at the shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "*9. Instruct shop-attendant not to allow any unauthorized person entry into the shop*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, only the owner and the shop attendant should enter inside the shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Word-Of-Mouth Always Works!*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is definitely the oldest form of marketing and advertising used by businesses since the world began. While it may bring slower results than radio or television, it still works very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a customer is happy and satisfied with a product or service, there’s a natural human tendency that they are likely to share this experience with people in their circle of trust and influence – family, friends, colleagues, neighbors and sometimes, strangers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A satisfied customer is one of the most effective marketing and advertising tools a small business can ever have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Satisfied customers become foot soldiers, evangelists and advocates for your business. It is amazing how many of your satisfied customers will go to great lengths to promote, convince, protect and defend your business outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word-of-mouth is so effective and powerful that many successful businesses rely solely on this method to advertise and market their products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how exactly can your liquor business grow an army of passionate customers who will use word-of-mouth advertising to your advantage?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I have a couple of ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Great customer experience.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most times, it doesn’t really matter how large or deep-pocketed your competition is. You can grow a successful business on great customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "People like to buy products and services from businesses that treat them with respect. People love to be given attention and treated well and will always return to enjoy that beautiful experience again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t forget, customers spend their hard-earned money on your products. Don’t you think they deserve a big “Thank you” with a wide smile on your face? People hardly forget a great customer experience and will happily tell other people about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Give your customers a reason to advertise and market your business.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, word-of-mouth advertising doesn’t come automatically; you have to encourage, motivate or incentivize your customers to do it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start a referral or reward program for your existing customers. The more people they refer to you, the more free products, services and discounts they will enjoy. The reward should be large enough to trigger their interest and make them take action. It’s a win-win method that always works.\n",
    "\n",
    "I once helped a friend of mine create a loyalty and referral program for her barbershop and beauty salon business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way it works is simple. All existing customers were registered and given a unique code. Whenever they spend money in the shop, it increases the total amount they have spent to date. If this total reaches a certain level, they are awarded certain discounts for all the services they pay for.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were four levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum) with increasing rewards. The results were amazing! Almost every customer was referring their family, friends, neighbours and total strangers to the salon to spend money under their code thereby increasing their totals and making them reach the Gold and Platinum levels faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the power of word of mouth. Make use of it and watch your business grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Digital Marketing*\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening a store is a good first step, but there’s no guarantee that ‘if you build it, they will come.’ Without a solid approach to marketing, you’ll likely spend your first few months in the business working in a mostly empty store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital marketing is a fast and affordable option that allows you to build a web presence and a social media following of hopefully thousands of potential customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "With an Instagram account, Facebook, and Twitter you can generate a buzz about your business before you even open your doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "And for more established businesses, it’s a great resource to engage with your customers and keep them informed of any special promotions or general communication that could impact them.\n",
    "\n",
    "From social media posts to blogs, your digital marketing methods can help you build a long-lasting presence in your community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of digital marketing as modern-day word-of-mouth advertising that has the potential to reach millions over a very short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to any other business right now, it’s important that your Wines and Spirits Shops in Kenya has an online presence. With 81% of shoppers researching online before making a purchase, your business needs to show up in search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure your business has a working website and that it’s optimized for search, especially for local search results. A large number of customers shop based on location, so if your business shows up as a nearby option, you’ll see a valuable increase in foot traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, encourage shoppers to leave positive reviews for your business online. This will increase your credibility when you show up in search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "By having a social media presence, you can easily connect with your customers and encourage them to leave reviews or refer others to your location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Posting value-added content on social media can be another major business driver. For instance, if you’re trying to sell a certain brandy, posting a mouthwatering drink recipe featuring the product can help push it off the shelves.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Competition*\n",
    "\n",
    "There is intense competition especially in urban areas and for this reason you need to ensure that your strategy is on point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scan the market conditions and set a realistic price. You also need to keep track of changes in market trends if you want to remain competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "But still you don’t have to worry much about competition. Provided you’re in a busy town, there will always be drinkers!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Expected Challenges*\n",
    "\n",
    "The first challenge you are going to face is intense competition. You will need to provide quality services and best prices in order to retain old customers who will in turn keep coming back with their friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to appreciate the challenge that you can only open your business from 5.00pm – 11.00pm on weekdays and 2:00pm – 11:00pm on weekends and public holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Don’ts*\n",
    "\n",
    "The following will land you in hot soup with the government agencies..\n",
    "\n",
    "*Opening before time\n",
    "\n",
    "*Selling to kids below 18 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Failure to renew licenses\n",
    "\n",
    "*Selling fake liquors\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run a Wine and Spirits business and have recently noticed that your takings have been going in the wrong direction, you need to take action sooner rather than later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, you can grow your wines and spirits business in Kenya in a number of ways. A combination of cost cutting and taking a long, hard look at how your business operates should help you turn things around.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Make sure any licenses you need are valid and up-to-date.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Although licensing requirements and the penalties for operating without a license vary by County, you risk losing your business and a fine if you’re caught trading illegally.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll also need to make sure you’re registered for and paying any tax you’re liable for. The amount of licensing costs you’re required to pay will vary depending on where you’re trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Check that you’re getting the lowest wholesale prices available to you.*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be able to greatly increase your profit margins by buying in larger amounts from an alternative supplier. It might be worth your while leasing some storage space if you can raise the capital to invest in a large amount of stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wholesalers will often give a sizable discount for buying in bulk thus help you grow your wines and spirits business in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Change your buying habits.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Study your till receipts and work out what you’re selling most of. If you find that you’re selling a lot of brandy and very little gin, expand your selection of brandy and run special offers to get your stock moving more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Offer discounts for bulk purchases.*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by launching a series of “Buy one, get one half price” deals, or offer larger percentage discounts for customers buying alcohol for special events or parties. This is one of the easiest ways to grow your wines and spirits business in Kenya\n",
    "\n",
    "*Audit your running costs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you’re paying as little as possible for your utilities and communications. You also can make savings by looking closely at your staffing levels. You may find that you can make substantial savings by letting a member of staff go and putting in a few extra hours behind the till yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Promote your store.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can’t afford to buy advertising space in local media, produce fliers and posters to hand out and display in other local businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also can hire a web designer to build a website for your business and set up social media accounts to promote your store. Social media is a cost effective way to market and grow your wines and spirits business in Kenya\n",
    "\n",
    "*Undercut your competitors.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This may reduce your profit margin, but you should make up for this in volume sales. You also can get the edge over the competition by offering a more personal service. Learn about the drinks you sell, and be on hand to offer your customers advice on their purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Request promotional items from distributors.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most distributors will keep you stocked with new displays, swag, and signage. Make sure you keep it updated, because it will make your store seem fresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stay on the right side of the law.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Selling to underage customers, even by mistake, can cost you thousands in fines and can even put your livelihood in jeopardy. Check identification diligently, and ask local law enforcement what you can do to make sure you don’t get fooled by a fake ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also beware of criminals, as liquor stores have often been targets of criminal activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*FINAL THOUGHTS*\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s no marathon race that has ever been won by those who did not start the race. If you like the idea discussed above and you have what it takes to actualize it… then don’t wait to start… just do it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes, your business idea may seem like a great solution. But it won’t succeed if you are the only one who sees it as such. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unable to identify a customer base beyond yourself, then it’s a warning sign that your idea will most likely fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the marketability of your business idea, you need to conduct extensive market research and find out if people would be interested in your proposed product or service.\n",
    "\n",
    "How big is the current market for your proposed business idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it an emerging market or a mature one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you in a new or mature category?\n",
    "\n",
    "Who are your potential customers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do they really need your proposed product or service?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the competition like?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can answer these questions by conducting online research, meeting with industry players, networking with others, and attending trade shows and exhibitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your answers will give you a big advantage in getting a handle on the opportunities within the market. They will also help you figure out if your initial assumptions about your proposed product or service are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how brilliant your idea may be, only paying customers can validate it and determine if it has great chances of success. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your “brilliant” business idea remains “just an idea” until you have paying customers attached to it. While anyone can discredit a simple idea, no one can discredit paying customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have been reading our series of business ideas articles in our PROFITABLE BUSINESS IDEAS Whatsapp Group, well, we hope you have already found that one idea that you would like to turn into a business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! But before you rush to invest there is just one more thing you need to do – a FEASIBILITY STUDY.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is a Feasibility Study?*\n",
    "\n",
    "A feasibility study is simply an assessment of the practicality of your proposed business idea. For instance, if your business idea is about Watermelon farming then your feasibility study will involve determining the capital requirements, competition and market availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are a farmer in Kilifi, Kenya, you will want to understand the market situation for your cashew nuts business. Likewise, if you are preparing to start a milk supply business in Nairobi you have to get the inside scoop of the business before you start.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most important study you will ever have to do in your life. And you don’t have to hire an expert to do it for you… we have broken it down into three super easy steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Step One: Analyze The Business Idea*\n",
    "\n",
    "This should always be the very first stage of your study. Look objectively at your idea and determine how lucrative it is. This is how you do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Potential Market Size*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say you have picked the idea of supplying kerosene lamps. At this stage, you need to ask yourself if there is market for your commodity and if yes, how big it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Competitive Advantage*\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes you a worthy competitor in the market? Do you have more experience than other players in the industry? In other words you want to figure out what makes you unique in a potentially crowded market place. Also, find out if anyone else have tried your idea, and if they failed – why?\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Assess Capital Requirements*\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for you, most of the business ideas we post in our PROFITABLE BUSINESS IDEAS Whatsapp group gives a rough breakdown and capital estimate for each idea. But besides that, you need to do your own research to get the real picture. Keep a small notebook where you can note all the specific cost outline down.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Two: A Deeper Analysis of the Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are satisfied that your idea is a good one, it’s time to take a closer look at the market. You goal at this stage is to determine what exactly the market needs and how they want it done.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Find the Differentiating Factor*\n",
    "\n",
    "A differentiating factor is simply that one thing that makes you attractive to customers. Ask yourself, why will customers want to purchase my product or service instead of my competitors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it because I can deliver faster than others or is it because I have better pricing methodology? What gap have your competitors left so that you can fill? Once you add a differentiating factor to your product or service, you will have an easier time penetrating the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Market Barriers Analysis*\n",
    "\n",
    "A market barrier is something that prevents you from entering a certain field of business at any one time. For instance, there is a barrier to starting a chemist shop since you have to get the approval of the Pharmacy and Poisons Boards. Look within your industry and see if there are any barriers that bar you from entering. Luckily, most business fields don’t have barriers to entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. What Makes Your Competitors Successful?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In every business there are competitors and learning what makes them successful is the surest way to get an inside scoop of the market conditions of your idea. So once again, keep a closer eye on your potential competitors so that you can fine-tune your game-plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Three: Financial Feasibility Analysis*\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, given that you have done idea analysis and a bit of market survey, we assume you have sufficient information on the nitty-gritty of running your business. So let’s now show you how to do the very last stages of a feasibility study.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Estimate The Start-up Cost*\n",
    "\n",
    "The start-up cost comprises the cost of setting up the business (e.g. renting a room, painting it, branding it etc.) and the initial working capital (i.e. the money you put into the business). Determine if your savings will be sufficient to start the business. If not, then think of external sources of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the entire cost of starting up should be made up of:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Cost of setting up the shop/office/working area\n",
    "\n",
    "-Cost of buying new equipment (e.g. popcorn machine, printer, wheelbarrow etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "-Cost of acquiring licenses and certificates (e.g. Single business permit, hygiene certificates among others)\n",
    "\n",
    "The working capital comprises of:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Cost of buying raw materials (e.g. braids for a salon, grocery for a restaurant etc.) and other ingredients\n",
    "\n",
    "-Cost of initial promotion of the business (For instance, you can choose to start your business with an offer price)\n",
    "\n",
    "-If you are going to hire any members of staff, you might incur some amount to train them\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Viable Is My Business Idea?*\n",
    "\n",
    "An idea is only viable if and only if (1) There is market for it (2) You have figured out how to finance it either through your savings or loan (3) You have a differentiating factor that sets you ahead of the competition (4) You are passionate about it (5) You are ready to be patient with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that some ideas may not be as lucrative from the onset. In fact in some cases you may even have to wait for 2 years in order for your business to start repaying you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you invest your money in any business idea, it is always wise to do a feasibility study. Sometimes this small measure of security can help you save a lot of cash that would otherwise be wasted chasing the wind – like most people do!\n",

    "\n",
    "Most people don’t like change. Fortunately, there’s nothing we can do about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change is a constant player in human life. While we may hate, fight and try to avoid it, change will always happen. And only smart entrepreneurs who have learnt to be friends with change and are ready to exploit it, are always handsomely rewarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially in rapidly growing economies like Africa, the tastes and needs of the market are constantly changing. Entrepreneurs must learn to watch out for trends and changes in their environments that could lead to new business ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of the trend, good or bad, is not very relevant. There’s always an opportunity to make money during both good and bad times.\n",
    "\n",
    "When people are excited, they buy. When they’re afraid, they buy. When we panic, we buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the recent outbreak of the Corona Virus pandemic, a palpable panic gripped alot of counties in the world including Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the authorities encouraged people to limit personal contact, improve hygiene and wash their hands frequently, the demand for sanitizing gels went through the roof, and most shops ran out of stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "An acquaintance of mine, a Kenyan pharmacist by training, did well to exploit this gap in the market. With his knowledge of chemicals, he was able to make a local, but equally effective, brand of hand sanitisers. \n",
    "\n",
    "As expected, he couldn’t make them fast enough, as his supplies disappeared into the ultra-high market demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Kenyan government put a ban on the use of plastic bags in order to reduce its negative environmental impact, a friend of mine knew that due to this change, businesses (especially in the retail sector) would need a new and recyclable type of packaging. \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the idea that led him to start his first paper bag production company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with only Ksh.20,000 capital, his business produces over 15,000 paper bags every week for its clients. His long list of clients includes restaurants, retail stores, supermarkets, medical centers, as well as multinational companies like Samsung.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good and bad trends either lead to opportunities to be exploited or problems that must be solved. Whichever way it swings, the smart entrepreneur always wins!\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to be on the lookout for changes, and fight the human impulse to fear them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, ask yourself: ‘Who will be affected by this new trend/change?’ and ‘What products or services will they need to adapt to the trend/change?’\n",
    "\n",
    "As an entrepreneur, you need to react to changes differently. Changes and trends usually lead to a reaction in the market and an upsurge in demand for certain products and services.\n",

    "Everybody tells you that your products are beautiful and amazing but nobody is bringing out their wallet to pay for them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even when there’s a serious need for the product or service, some businesses still find it hard to sell their products to enough customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would this happen?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Too expensive*\n",

    "\n",
    "I am sure you will take one day out of your busy schedule to ‘manually’ kill all the rats yourself or find much cheaper alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when the need is there and the product is right, a high price can spoil a sale. For most people, price is a sensitive issue. If the price is too high, they won’t buy.\n",

    "*Wrong market*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you set up a Rolex watch business in a low-income neighbourhood, what do you expect? \n",

    "That’s why location is a very important factor in setting up any business.\n",

    "If you are surrounded by people who cannot afford to buy the products or services you are selling, then you are definitely in trouble. \n",

    " \n",
    "People in busy offices always get hungry and most businesses or companies are not willing to take the time and expense of installing a vending machine. Therefore, you can invest in food vending machines and pop machines.\n",
    " \n",
    "A vending machine business is a retail business that does not require face to face interaction with customers, and can be run for 24 hours a day depending on the location.\n",
    " \n",
    "You can either choose to install the machines for a small fee or for free to the property owner and you get to keep all the profits from the machine. This business idea has a lot of potential hence it can scale to grow throughout your town or city.\n",
    " \n",
    "This business (just like the milk and salad oil vending machines business) is one that offers operators flexibility, because it can be tailored to suit the lifestyle of the owner, thereby creating a balance between work, life and family. \n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurs can also go fully into other businesses, while others can decide to make it a part-time business venture.\n",
    " \n",
    "So far, I have come across only 3 people doing this kind of business here in Kenya which means you can make it big now when the competition is very low.\n",
    " \n",
    "You simply need to import a vending machine that dispenses healthy bitings and beverages. Then you will need to look for a prime location either in town or some busy offices.\n",
    " \n",
    "A vending machine dispenses items such as beverages, snacks, lottery tickets, alcohol, cigarettes, tattoos, toys, candy and so much more.\n",
    " \n",
    "There are very strict laws regarding the sale of alcohol and cigarettes through vending machines due to concerns regarding underage buyers.\n",
    " \n",
    "Before starting a vending machine business, there are certain questions you would need to answer, so as to get an idea of what you intend to achieve. The questions are:\n",
    " \n",
    "*Do you intend to go into the business as a part or full time owner?\n",
    " \n",
    "*Will you be a sole operator or get into partnership with someone?\n",
    " \n",
    "*How much capital is needed and how much is available and where you would need to source for finances for the business?\n",
    " \n",
    "*What your goals are, short, medium and long term?\n",
    " \n",
    "*What kind of machines would you need to get? Would they be new or used?\n",
    " \n",
    "The demographic and psychographic of vending machine users depends on the location of the machine, and the products offered by the machine.\n",
    " \n",
    "For example; gumballs vending machines are likely to cater to the needs of children and young adults. Coffee vending machines will cater to young adults and adults of whatever gender, while that of generic snack and drinks will likely cater to almost all age groups except those who are extra health conscious.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Finding and securing the right location* for your vending machine is important in building a successful vending machine business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most successful vending machines are located in areas where there is high foot traffic such as, movie theaters, shopping malls, community centers, hotel and bank lobbies, restaurants, medical centers or hospitals, schools, public farms and office complex.\n",
    " \n",
    "Another key factor to consider while seeking for a suitable location for your vending machine business is *the products you intend to dispense from your machine*, for instance, it wouldn’t make any sense if you place vending machines that dispense hot coffee in restaurants, as you won’t get much people using your vending machine, or if your vending machine dispenses toys in a college setting.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you sell the wrong products, your vending machine business might struggle.\n",
    " \n",
    "Another thing is the *purchasing power of the clients* where your vending machine is placed. You cannot hope to sell premium goods in a low priced mall or shopping center, especially as the people that would patronize such places are the low income earners.\n",
    " \n",
    "Thankfully, you can operate from home for this kind of business, especially as the vending machines need to be placed in places of high traffic, therefore working for you even when you aren’t there, but once you begin to employ people to help monitor the machine, you would need an office facility, where your employees can report to, it doesn’t necessarily have to be a big facility but it should be at a central point to the location of your vending machines.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Create a Suppliers/Distribution Network*\n",
    " \n",
    "Regardless of whether you own just one or several vending machines, you would need a network of suppliers or distributors that will make your job of sourcing for products, or getting the available products on time for your customers.\n",
    " \n",
    "This means being in a good business relationship with these distributors as it will help you be more reliable to your customers especially in regards to filling the machine immediately the products have finished.\n",
    " \n",
    "If the right relationship is cultivated, the distributors might not only help in the timely delivery of products but might also pass along certain information that might be beneficial to your business and help retain customers.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Tips for Running a Vending Machine Business Successfully*\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a vending machine might look like an easy business but it can be a quicksand for entrepreneurs that run the business badly.\n",
    " \n",
    "The first thing to always remember is that the customer is the king, and to give them the best treatment by not getting lazy at filling the machine on time. The easiest way for the business to fail is not to bother about whether your machine is empty or filled.\n",
    " \n",
    "Also ensure that the machine is kept clean, and well maintained. If it has got a problem, it shouldn’t be out of order for a long period. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another tip at running a vending machine successfully is to ensure that the machines are kept at the best and most accessible locations, a location that doesn’t inconvenience the customer when they intend to use the machine.\n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "I am sure that the first thing that comes to your mind when you think about farming is land. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most people are discouraged from starting dairy farming because they do not have “enough land”.\n",
    "\n",
    "But look at what Nancy Karanja is doing on Sanla Farm. On just half an acre of land, where she lives and has three green houses, she is also keeping 20 dairy cows and getting over 500 litres of milk every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eden Farm, which earns the young Kanja more than Ksh.1 million every month, occupies not more than just 2 acres.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you see, even if you have a 40 X 80 piece of land, you can still do dairy farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you always wondered why dairy farming has become popular in the country? \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Did you know that you can earn up-to Ksh.40,000 per month with 3 dairy cows?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya has been identified as the highest performer in Africa when it comes to dairy farming. Breeds that are used in Kenya are high breeders which yield milk between 25 to 50 Litres of milk per day with good management.\n",
    "\n",
    "One cow can produce an average milk yield of 30 Litres per day which is approximately 270 litres of milk from one cow per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Monthly Financial Income*\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently milk goes for Ksh.30 per litre at brookside. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you a gross income of 3 cows × 30 litres per day × Ksh.30 per litre × 30 days = Ksh.81,000 milk sales from 3 cows in one month.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of production is usually half the amount of litres per cow. The net income per month will therefore be\n",
    "\n",
    "Ksh.81,000 – Ksh.40,500 = Ksh.40,500 profit from 3 cows per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be successful in Dairy farming largely depends on the farmers’ ability to select the correct breeds of dairy animals for their various agro-ecological zones, correct feeding of the dairy animals and good management on various aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, to start dairy farming you need to be patient and have the capital needed to practice. i.e Capital to buy the cow itself, dairy feed, cow shelters and feeding troughs, veterinary expenses and a source of water.\n",

    "\n",
    "Adjacent farms hosting several crops that include maize and wheat are equally choking in dust. A signpost with the inscriptions “Pokea Dairy Farm, distributors of Hoisteins genetics for longevity and fitness cows built to last from Germany. Ask for artificial insemination services,” informs us that we have arrived at our destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Welcome to Pokea Farm,” farmer James Ndung’u says as he ushers us into the 17-acre farm that he has built to one of the finest dairy outfits in Kenya. He is not only a top breeder but also a leading milk producer, supplying his produce to Brookside Dairy, Njoro Farmers Cooperative Society and individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "His Holstein Friesian animals are distinctively black and white, although some light brown animals can also be spotted from far. They are sparkling clean, are big and bulky with sagging udders dripping with milk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cows have short horns and weigh between 500kg and 650kg, according to the records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Away from the cows, the cowsheds are well-ventilated with fine timber dust that is changed at least thrice a week to ensure high levels of hygiene making the beddings. The drinking troughs have clean water while the feeding mangers had some hay during our visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Eight acres is under Boma Rhodes grass, napier grass is on two acres while maize is on four acres. Sorghum occupies one acre, lucerne a quarter acre while the rest host barns, milking parlour and grazing field,” says Ndung’u of his meticulously planned farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enterprising farmer has 60 cows, 30 of which are pedigree and from the current 10 lactating stock, he gets an average of 400 litres of milk each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "His cows produce about 40 litres a day each, a feat that many farmers dream of. But there is one which offers up to 55 litres.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This is the magic cow. It gives me the most,” says Ndung’u as he strokes the animal. “I have never treated it against any diseases apart from now when I am closely monitoring mastitis as it is getting old.”\n",
    "\n",
    "And he has a piece of advice: “If you want to reap big from dairy farming, invest in your breeds because what you put in is what you get.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The Holstein Friesian pedigree animal has brought him fame and fortune.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‘champion’ produces an average of 44 litres of milk a day, hitting the over 50 litres some days, with no problem with mastitis. At between Sh.35 and Sh.50 per litre, it means the cow, which is now nine years old, earns Ndung’u a fortune.\n",
    "\n",
    "When he bought semen from USA at Sh.7,000 sometimes back, some farmers chided him, saying he was wasting money yet he could go for cheap semen of Sh.500.\n",
    "\n",
    "“But I do not regret. Every time dairy farmers ask me the secret of success, my answer is very simple: The choice of high quality semen is the first step to running a profitable dairy enterprise because you are assured of a top breed with minimal disease concerns,” Ndung’u, who started the business in 1979 with one cow after investing Sh.50,000 loan from Agricultural Finance Corporation, says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Tuesday, Pokea Farm is a beehive of activity as farmers from across the country and outside assemble there seeking fresh ideas on how to boost their milk production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers who come as a group are charged Sh.300 per person while individuals pay Sh.500. We found four filled visitors’ books signed by guests from Kenya, USA, Norway, Germany, Hungary, South Africa, Zambia, and even Somalia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ndung’u, whose body frame and energy does not betray his 80 years, engages in the best animal husbandry practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a calf is born, it is critical that it develops a straight top line by making it almost skinny to prepare for a high milk production in future.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This is a secret that not many farmers know. To make a calf produce that straight top line, give it salt, hay and water in the first three months and reduce the consumption of early concentrates. The calf will look ill-fed with protruding ribs but this is an indication that the veins are now stronger and will allow faster blood movement and increase food efficiency resulting later to more milk production,” says the former primary school teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr Permius Migwi, a veterinary expert from Egerton University, says the feeding of animals with salts and adequate minerals help to build a strong backbone.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Minerals and good feeding in the early stages is crucial as it culminates in a strong backbone,” says Dr Migwi.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Ndung’u, raising healthy animals has a lot to do with managing a cow’s stress, an area many farmers score poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A cow also needs enough rest and should not be moved from one point to another unnecessarily as this will stress it and interfere with its milk production system,” says Ndung’u, a father of three.\n",
    "\n",
    "“At the same time the animals should be left to relax after milking and should not be moved hurriedly.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Cows at Pokea Farm are bathed twice a week with hot water mixed with Sunlight powder. Special attention is given to the udder.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We also clean the cowsheds twice a day to make sure teats are not infected with mastitis or other diseases.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the animals, the more than 20 staff on the farm too maintain high-level of hygiene.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There is no point of having a clean cow that is being handled by a dirty worker as this will definitely affect the health of the animal. All my workers bath before handling animals,” says Ndung’u, who has invested heavily in training staff. He also spends Sh.300,000 on salary monthly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training has equipped his workers with knowledge to detect problems an animal has and the remedy to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ndungu feeds his dairy cows on napier grass, Rhodes grass, lucerne, maize and sorghum silage, which is nutritious and contains energy and protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I mix a tonne of silage with 20kg of dried pyrethrum to curb aflatoxin. You have to feed a cow according to its weight. We feed a cow that weighs 650kg with 30kg silage and 20kg roughage twice a day,” he says, noting the animals are fed at 9am, 1pm and 5pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If a dairy farmer strictly adheres to such a feeding programme, which includes concentrates, the animals will remain healthy and produce more milk.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many farmers, he does not bury his silage in the ground. He harvests his fodder at dough stage and covers it in a canvas and then puts soil on top, avoiding excess moisture.\n",
    "\n",
    "He sells heifers at between Sh.150,000 and Sh.250,000 while pedigree cows go for between Sh.300,000 and Sh.600,000. His clients range from the small farmer to who-is-who in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I import Friesian Holstein sexed semen from Germany to serve my cows, which guarantees me the calves born are all female,” says Ndung’u, who also sells semen to farmers at between Sh.500 and Sh.9,600.\n",
    "\n",
    "His animals are vaccinated against diseases such as lump-skin, foot and mouth and East Coast Fever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recordkeeping and a strict business plan is also part of the high milk yield strategy on the farm. “All the details of every cow, including the artificial insemination date, date of birth, diseases and milk production, among others, are documented,” says Ndung’u whose animals are registered with the Kenya Stud Book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ndung’u has drilled a borehole at a cost of Sh.4 million that supplies 10,000 litres of water in two hours for the animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "His success in dairy farming has put Kenya on the global dairy map as he won the prestigious Golden Award for Commercial Prestige in Madrid, Spain in 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "He received overwhelming support from 112 countries and 7,000 companies in the dairy industry across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ndung’u has also received awards as a top breeder in all local trade fairs he has attended.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of his biggest challenges is poor commercial feeds and substandard minerals, which affects milk production. The turnover of workers is another challenge as he is forced to invest in training of staff who seek greener pastures elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diseases such as foot and mouth, mastitis and lump skin too are a menace, though he has managed to keep them at bay for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "One piece of advice he always gives farmers is that they should treat their animals like newly-born babies and make sure they are vaccinated against diseases, just like children. They must also make sure they have the best feeds in their formative years.\n",
    "\n",
    "He plans to retire and pass the baton to his son John Karanja who lives in USA and has shown a keen interest in dairy farming.\n",

    "Getting into entrepreneurship is becoming a popular trend among youth in Kenya. Starting a small bakery business is a profitable business idea you can explore especially if you have a passion for cooking. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, owning a bakery business needs a lot of commitment and capital but it’s a great way to earn extra income. \n",
    "\n",
    "A bakery is also a good business idea because baked goods are quite popular and move quite fast. Baking also requires little to no formal training but if you need to sharpen your skills, you could consider taking a few baking classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a bakery is a business you would like to get into, here is what you need to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. GETTING STARTED*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Register the bakery* – If your plan is to run your bakery as a full fledged business, you will need to register your company name (cost – approx Ksh.1,000), register your limited company (cost – approx Ksh.30,000), get a KEBS licence (cost – approx Ksh.20,000) and a single business permit (cost varies from county to county)\n",

    "\n",
    "*2. THE BUSINESS*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get Your Recipes Ready* – Create a list of all the baked goods you intend to sell. Start with a few items and diversify to more products with time. Prepare a Menu. Prepare a Price list that puts in consideration the cost of ingredients, labor and any other expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get Your Ingredients Ready* – Purchase all the ingredients you need; flour, sugar etc. Also purchase packaging materials, labels, boxes and anything else you’ll need.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Marketing* – Find out your target market. Baked products sell quite fast in offices, schools, canteens and local kiosks. Where exactly is your demand?\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure out how to grab the attention of your target audience by using specific marketing strategies like using fliers, posters, social media, etc.\n",

    "Fragrance products make up one of the largest segments in personal care industry with growth at a double digits annually.\n",

    "\n",
    "Despite the serious security threats that nannies now represent, it’s a surprise that the demand for nannies is still huge, especially in the big cities across Africa. \n",
    "\n",
    "How come? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three major factors that are responsible for the high demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. There are more working mothers in the cities*\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in the day, most mothers used to sit back at home and take care of the children while daddy was the ‘sole breadwinner’. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the era of the ‘full-time housewife’ is almost gone. To increase household income and provide additional financial support for the family, more urban African women are now job-employed or self-employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "City life often means that in many common cases, mothers who work at day jobs have to leave their children early in the morning and may not return until late in the evening. Many of these mothers have children who are as young as 6 months old.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, mothers who do not have a close and trusted family relative to help them with childcare often have to look outside for help. \n",
    "\n",
    "This category of mothers are very likely to hire commercial nannies to look after their children. It can be very risky to leave young children in the care of ‘strangers’ but most families simply do not have any other options.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Africa’s middle class population is in rapid growth*\n",
    "\n",
    "The middle class is the single largest source of demand for nannies in Africa. Poor households are unlikely to afford a commercial nanny service.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a Deloitte research report, Africa’s middle class population has tripled over the last 30 years and may reach 1.1 billion people by 2060. \n",
    "\n",
    "Middle class households often have two working parents who may be educated and work at a job or owned business. \n",
    "\n",
    "These households typically spend between Ksh.6,000 and Ksh.60,000 on household and living expenses per month, and can afford to pay for convenience services like nannies.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the middle class segment of Africa’s population continues to grow, it’s expected that the demand for commercial nannies will remain huge and continue to increase across the major cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Nannies provide convenience and flexibility*\n",
    "\n",
    "For anyone reading this article who has had any kind of experience with young children, you would know that taking care of kids can be a challenging full-time job. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even ‘full-time housewives’ still need some help with children so that they can get other things done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although commercial nannies may pose a huge security threat, it’s difficult to ignore the convenience, flexibility and comfort in the service they provide to many households. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s common for nannies to help with other chores in the home like cleaning and cooking. These too go a long way to help young mothers who have to deal with the pressures of work and family.\n",
    "\n",
    "*To Solve The Nanny Problem, You Need To Know These Three Pains…*\n",
    "\n",
    "During my research for this article, I was curious to know what parents thought about the whole commercial nanny situation. From the responses I got, many of the people I talked to were most concerned about the following issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tip:* You need to pay close attention to these ‘pains’ because most parents are willing to pay money to make them go away. There’s money to be made by entrepreneurs who can solve these pains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Identification & Character*\n",
    "\n",
    "Parents would like to know the true identity and character of the nannies they hire. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many parts of Africa, most people still don’t have a full, proper and trusted means of identification. So, when things go wrong, it can be very difficult to find a rogue nanny if she disappears with the kids. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like the case of the Orekoya family in Nigeria, the nanny presented a fake name and ID. This made it possible for her to successfully kidnap the kids and evade detection for several days.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Quality of Care*\n",
    "\n",
    "Parents are concerned about the quality of care their kids get from the nanny in their absence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most nannies on the continent do not have any kind of formal training in child care. Without training and childcare knowledge, it’s no surprise that some nannies cause physical, psychological and sexual harm to the children they care for.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fear*\n",
    "\n",
    "Parents want to be assured that their children are treated well in their absence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cases like Jolly Tumuhiirwe, the vicious Ugandan nanny who brutalized the 18-month old child in her care caused a panic in many families. \n",
    "\n",
    "Parents want to know for a fact that their kids never suffer this sort of abuse when they are away from the home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the biggest pains, problems and challenges that many African middle class families are having with the commercial nanny service, it’s time to look at a few ideas and opportunities that could make money in this market.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Four Interesting Business Opportunities in Africa’s Commercial Nanny Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "How much do you think any parent will pay to ensure safety, security and quality care for their children? \n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is, as long as the price is reasonable, many parents are willing to pay a premium to get the best care and treatment for their kids.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I will share with you four interesting business opportunities you can exploit in the current commercial nanny market.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Professional Nanny Recruitment Services*\n",
    "\n",
    "For most parents, finding the right nanny is a huge challenge. In the current market, most people find nannies via informal sources (through friends, family, neighbours and colleagues). There are also a few ‘nanny agents’ who can help with finding a nanny.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these sources can help families find ‘any’ nanny, the real challenge is finding the ‘right’ nanny with the right character, knowledge and skills to properly take care of their children. This type of professional recruitment service is still lacking on the continent.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if there was a professional nanny service that hires suitable people for the nanny job? \n",
    "\n",
    "This service could properly recruit and identify potential nannies (including full identity documentation and background checks) and give them a few weeks of intensive childcare training that would cover all the major aspects of taking care of children.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could make money by charging an upfront recruitment or ‘finder’s’ fee or you could just take an agency or management fee percentage from the nanny’s monthly pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you think parents will pay for a verified and trained professional nanny over a random nanny some friend found for them? \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer looks very obvious to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Nanny Training School*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not even need to go the full recruitment route. What if you had a school for training professional nannies? \n",
    "\n",
    "I have never heard of that one before. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nurses and midwifes have training schools, even chefs have training schools, so why not nannies?\n",
    "\n",
    "For a modest fee, you could offer short courses to people who want to enter the nanny services industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t forget, nanny services are highly demanded like I mentioned earlier, and has the potential to provide temporary and permanent employment to thousands of Africans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through training, prospective nannies could be taught the importance of their roles in the lives of the young children they care for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Topics like ethics, child safety, nutrition, medical emergencies, hygiene and professional etiquette and conduct are some of the major courses that will provide the right orientation and skills for people in the nanny profession.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you provide effective training solutions, it may only be a matter of time before parents and childcare organisations knock on your door to hire your most qualified students.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Creche & Daycare Centres*\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of hiring a full-time commercial nanny, more parents are choosing to keep their children in crèches and daycare centres. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these centres are open from the early mornings to late evenings and have become ideal for working mothers who work at day jobs from Mondays to Fridays and stay at home during weekends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most daycare centres are located within residential areas (where working mothers live) or around commercial/office areas (where working mothers work). \n",
    "\n",
    "This proximity and convenience makes daycare services more appealing to families who want more professional care for their children.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, we wrote a detailed article sometimes ago about the Daycare Service business. \n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Home Surveillance Solutions*\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the help of a hidden camera in the living room of their home, it may have been impossible to discover the shocking brutality of the vicious Ugandan nanny.\n",
    "\n",
    "With advances in modern technology, it is now possible to choose from a very wide range of small and deceptive surveillance devices to capture pictures, video or audio of happenings in your home. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these devices can be accessed remotely. So, from their offices or outside locations, parents can actually watch or listen to events that happen in their homes when they are not around. Awesome!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these systems are affordable and you could set up a business that specifically targets parents who have vulnerable kids at home. You could sell, install, troubleshoot and maintain home surveillance systems in high-risk areas of your clients’ homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you may not need to set up a physical shop to get going with this idea. Using the smart online and social media marketing strategies, you can specifically target the demographic of young mothers who may be having nanny problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*My Final Thoughts…*\n",
    "\n",
    "The nanny problem has a strong emotional dimension in the way it affects parents who need nanny services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Childcare is a very sensitive job that requires only people who are professional, skilled and passionate about children. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because, the devastating effects of child neglect, psychological torture, physical and sexual abuse can last for a lifetime and may damage the child forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this article to spark a debate about the terrible state of the unregulated, informal and low quality nanny services industry in Africa.\n",
    " \n",
    "As a strong believer in entrepreneurship, I hold the opinion that we can solve Africa’s serious nanny problem and still make money from it. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a win-win for everyone!\n",

    "\n",
    "While starting out in the business world, I came across some “business teachers” who I respect so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "These people inspired me in a lot of ways and one thing I remember one of my models wrote in his books is, “everybody can be a business owner”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is that true?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can everybody become an entrepreneur?\n",
    "\n",
    "I believed everyone could become an entrepreneur until after spending about four years in the business world.\n",
    "\n",
    "After facing the heat and fire of the business world, I decided to question what my mentor had earlier made me to believe. The truth is, not everybody can become a business owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isn`t this pessimistic, especially when you are reading this from me, a Business Man & Mentor with the mission to train as many as possible Africans to be business owners?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, my goal is not to train everybody to be a business owner. My mission is to train every man/woman who can, to be an entrepreneur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everybody can be a doctors. Many people don`t have what it takes to be lawyers. Many of us hate to be soldiers. So, why should anybody think that everybody should be a business owner?\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, we don`t have to get every adult to have a business for Africa to be a better continent. We only need to get a very good percentage to be business owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can successfully get 25% to 30% of our youths to be business owners, I mean educated business owners, business owners who understand the business world, we can be sure that we are never going to know anything called unemployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? \n",
    "\n",
    "Because some of these trained business owners will become successful business men and women who will employ hundreds and thousands of people, others will become average successful who will employ tens of people and some will employ between 1 to 5 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, those who cannot become business owners will be gainfully employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you get my point?\n",
    "\n",
    "We must all have this understanding that school doesn`t do anything wrong by teaching children how to become employees (of course, some people have to become employees). \n",
    "\n",
    "School gets it all wrong by teaching ALL children to be employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "But am happy our government has introduced a better education system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We all cannot become entrepreneurs, but should we all become employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, who will provide jobs for us?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you see where the problem lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you know whether you can become a business owner or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Believe me, many of us can be business owners… if we are trained to be.\n",

    "\n",
    "Children, though come to the world with some inborn traits, can be trained to think in one direction or the other. If you train them to think in a particular direction, they are likely to believe that that is the only direction that exists, or at least that`s the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "That exactly is what school does.\n",
    "\n",
    "By teaching all the children that a good job is the best way to make money, most of us never dreamed of becoming a business owner… even though we could be.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "From a glance, thorn melon (also known as kiwano or horned melon) might pass for just another ugly and worthless wild fruit of the African Jungle. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as an entrepreneur and somebody who cares about good health, a closer look at the spiky tropical fruit will reveal endless potential waiting to be exploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "First the fruit is rich in nutrients. It has made headlines across the world, and here in Kenya The Daily Nation and The Standard Newspapers have lauded its perceived health benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, it offers rich pickings for investors presenting a better alternative use of small chunks of land. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have a small ka-plot lying idle somewhere, this might just be the best way to utilize it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the profitability and viability of this idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Getting Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very easy to get started. First you need to find land that sits anywhere in the altitude of 200 and 1800 feet above the sea level. Most parts of Kenya fall under this range. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides altitude, you need to consider soil PH between 6.0 and 6.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn’t have to be a large chunk of land – you can start with whatever small you have and then scale up as demand and production level out. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can plant on open ground but greenhouse tends to give even better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: How to Obtain Seeds*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either choose to obtain ready seedlings from KARI or propagate some for yourself at home. \n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to pick a mature healthy fruit to extract the seeds. Then ferment the seeds for 3 days in a plastic container before planting.\n",
    " \n",
    "Normally, it takes 3 weeks for germination to take place. After germination, you should then transfer the plantlets to the farm in well spaced holes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Holes should be spaced in 60cm by 60cm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Consider adding compost manure to the hole before planting\n",
    "\n",
    "*The best fertilizer to use is NPK 17:17:17\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is a climbing plant so you need to provide enough space for it to grow\n",
    "\n",
    "*You can spray leaves of mature plants with foliar feeds to maximize on production\n",
    "\n",
    "*No pesticides are needed, the plant is quite hardy\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Harvesting and Productivity*\n",
    "\n",
    "After planting, you will need to wait for 3 months for the crop to mature and start producing healthy fruits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Harvesting is done by simply picking the ripe fruits and putting them gently inside a bucket. \n",
    "\n",
    "The average shelf life of a harvested kiwano fruit is 6 months – giving you adequate time to find market for your produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "On average Ksh.3,500 would be enough to start a small 1/8 acre (50ftx100ft) farm with about 80 plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "A single plant produces 15 fruits per season translating to potential revenue of Ksh.25,000 per harvest on 1/8 acre farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be a great side-hustle especially if you have a plot of land that lies idle. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fruit can be grown on black cotton soil as well as red volcanic soil. \n",
    "\n",
    "So why not put that ka-plot of yours in Ruai, Kitengela, Isinya, Rongai or Joska to better use?\n",

    " \n",
    "Now before you rush into investing your money in any investment product, I think it’s worthwhile you read the following tips on the best investment product to invest your money in. \n",
    "\n",
    "What should you invest in?\n",
    " \n",
    "*1. Invest in something you understand*\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a strong inter-relationship between business and investing. Just as it’s advisable you start a business with a thorough understanding of the industry you are going into; the same is applicable to investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes I find it funny that people actually start a business or buy an investment product based on the recommendation of a friend or their financial adviser. \n",
    "\n",
    "Others invest in an investment product just because someone succeeded with that same product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without financial knowledge, people look for someone to tell them what to do and where to put their money. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like Lemmings simply following their leader, these people race for the cliff and leap into the ocean of financial uncertainty; hoping they can swim to the other side.\n",
    " \n",
    "Sincerely speaking, I believe this approach is wrong. Understanding is vital to any endeavor you find yourself in life including investing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t jump into any investment; be it stocks or real estate without first understanding the intricacies of such investment.\n",
    " \n",
    "Lack of understanding is the primary reason why investors panic in an economic downturn. With understanding, you will be able to maximize your profit; manage risk and minimize your loss in any investment.\n",
    " \n",
    "*2. Invest in something you are passionate about*\n",
    "\n",
    "Passion is what keeps you going when the going gets tough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know why Warren Buffett emerged the world’s richest investor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Or Donald Trump the biggest real estate developer in New York City?\n",
    " \n",
    "The answer is that they are both passionate about their chosen investment field. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have to be passionate about investing to get the best out of it; you must love the game regardless of whether you win or lose.\n",
    " \n",
    "Never invest in something you are not passionate about; you will only end up with heartache.\n",
    " \n",
    "*3. Invest in something you are willing to learn through*\n",
    " \n",
    "Life is a teacher; the more we live, the more we learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing constant in life is change and in the world of investing; such change occur very rapidly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now how do you stay in control when the tidal wave of change comes?\n",
    "\n",
    "How can your investment strategy stay relevant in times of change?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer lies in continuous learning. Investing is like a rapidly flowing river and to stay on course; you have to be on the edge, ever ready to learn.\n",
    " \n",
    "Never invest in something you hate learning about; no matter how lucrative it may be. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you find reading annual reports boring; or you hate charts, math, calculations and all the jargon associated with technical analysis. Then stay away from stocks.\n",
    "  \n",
    "If you hate fixing toilets; then stay away from real estate or better still, partner with someone who loves fixing toilets.\n",
    " \n",
    "The lesson I am trying to emphasize here is this: never invest in something you are not willing to learn through.\n",
    " \n",
    "*4. Invest in something you are willing to stick with*\n",
    " \n",
    "For everything there is a season. Business and investing has its good time and bad time; highs and lows. If you are not persistent enough, you will give up.\n",
    " \n",
    "So before you commit your money to any business idea or investment; be sure you are prepared to follow it through to the end, which might lead you to either losing your money or making some profit.\n",
    " \n",
    "Never invest in something you are not willing to stick your neck with.\n",
    " \n",
    "*5. Invest in something you have control over*\n",
    " \n",
    "Lastly, control is one of the most important criteria every successful investor looks out for in an investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Never lose control of your investment because control is essential to risk management.\n",
    " \n",
    "The reason I chose building a business as my best investment opportunity is because I have absolute control over it. I can increase my sales, control my cash flow, adjust my liquidity ratio, and sell the business or hold.\n",
    " \n",
    "I equally know the necessary buttons to press to increase the value of my business if ever I decide to sell. \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the power of control.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know a lot of investors who have conceded their power of control to stockbrokers, fund managers, financial advisers and analysts. Don’t do the same.\n",
    " \n",
    "As a final note, these are the five factors I feel are most important to cross check before sinking your hard earned cash into any investment.\n",
    " \n",
    "Never fall in love with an investment opportunity without first considering these factors because they are fundamental to sound investing and wealth building.\n",

    "\n",
    "Just like brushing your teeth and wearing clothes, having our hair done has become an essential requirement of modern society. \n",
    "\n",
    "For people to take us seriously, we need to look well-groomed for both social and business reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these hair grooming services cannot be easily done at home, most people have to visit a beauty salon or barbershop at least once every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "A barbershop (locally known as Kinyozi) is a good example of a sustainable business because people will always need haircuts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fashion styles may come and go, but hair cuts aren’t a fad or trend – they are a basic necessity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, Kenya’s middle-class is growing at an alarming rate and you can jump onto this tide by starting your own executive barbershop.\n",
    "\n",
    "One good thing about Kinyozi business is that it is not seasonal. Business flows in as usual come rain come shine. \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it a worthwhile venture to delve into. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a step by step guide on what it takes to start an executive barbershop.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Getting Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start your own barbershop you will need to become a barber. \n",
    "\n",
    "A beauty course in one of the many training centres in the country is inexpensive, and you can complete school and obtain your recommendations within a short period. \n",
    "\n",
    "If however you’re not interested in becoming a barber (or if you are busy with your current occupation) then you can always consider the option of hiring a trained barber.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Find Ideal Premises*\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the ideal location is one that is easy to locate and access. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most first-time customers to your business will be walk-in customers and therefore it is important to maximize on available foot traffic by choosing a strategic location for your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that you might be required to pay a good-will fee on some of the prime locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average rent prices in residential areas in urban centres vary from Ksh.5,000 – Ksh.30,000 per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same unit may go for Ksh.3,000 – Ksh.7,000 per month in rural areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "High end streets attract premium rents of above Ksh.80 per square foot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that some landlords require payment of a deposit prior to moving in.\n",
    "\n",
    "So just to be safe, set aside a budget of Ksh.20,000 for premises if you are moving into a Ksh.10,000 per month premises.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Shop Fit Out*\n",
    "\n",
    "Call in a carpenter to carry out a basic shop fit out. This may include installing mirrors, cabinets as well as painting the shop. \n",
    "\n",
    "On average carpentry labour costs Ksh.1,000 per day. The entire project may take three days and therefore you should budget for Ksh.20,000 or more depending on how beautiful you want your interior.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Apply For Licenses*\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic form of license you will require in order to operate is the single business permit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cost of this permit varies from county to county with small stalls attracting as little as Ksh.7,000 license cost per year in some regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those in the Nairobi Metropolitan region are advised to set aside at least Ksh.20,000 for single business permit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Buy Equipment*\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example of a shopping list you can use. Note that it is not mandatory to buy all the items listed as you start. You can forego some of them and stock up on as the business grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2 Basic barber chairs – Ksh.10,000 each (Locally made)\n",
    "\n",
    "*2 WAHL Clippers – Ksh.3,000 each\n",
    "\n",
    "*Equipment Sterilizer – Ksh.10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Locally Made Sink Seat – Ksh.15,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cosmetic Products – Ksh.3,000 (Including spirit and after-shave)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fabric sheets, towels, apron – Ksh.3,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hair Style Charts – Ksh.1,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Waiting Lounge Chair – Ksh.1,500\n",
    "\n",
    "*Water heating & storage – Ksh.5,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Small Basins – Ksh.1,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Backup Generator – Ksh.50,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Entertainment System – Ksh.30,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hire and keep qualified, trained personnel*\n",
    "\n",
    "Untrained personnel are more likely to cause harm and health problems to your clients (and a liability to your business).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you hire only qualified and well-trained barbers, beauticians, stylists, and other personnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is your responsibility as the owner to ensure that your personnel are adequately trained and understand the importance of safe procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have to consider providing training classes on a regular basis to help your personnel improve their product knowledge, skills and awareness of the latest trends in beauty, fashion and style. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hardest thing with personnel in this business is keeping them. Good, well trained and professional stylists and beauticians are in constant demand and can leave your staff at very short notice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big challenge is to devise a strategy (just like with your customers) to keep them invested in your business. A good strategy is to let your employees earn a slice of money (commission) made from any services they offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way, when they work more, they earn more and vice versa. This strategy works better than a flat wage or monthly salary which is usually the single biggest costs for any salon or barbershop business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, the best way to get the kind of well-trained and professional personnel you are looking for is to poach them from your competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "They may cost you more, but they are usually worth the money and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perks, performance incentives and awards are simple but often overlooked ways of reducing staff turnover and ensuring stability in your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get close to your clients and keep them satisfied always.*\n",
    "\n",
    "A barbershop or salon’s best advertisement tool is word-of-mouth. If a client is happy with your services, they will continue coming back and are very likely to tell their friends, family, and colleagues about your salon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Satisfied clients are the best and cheapest means of letting everyone know about your business. Another great reason to keep clients satisfied is the volume of repeat business they bring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lifetime value of each and every customer is in thousands of shillings – if they continue to visit at least once a month over the next five to twenty years. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, keeping your clients satisfied doesn’t mean another barbershop can’t and won’t do the same, or even better. A simple way to keep all your clients glued to your barbershop is to win their trust by getting personal with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by implementing a simple customer loyalty program. Repeat customers get discounts for paying regular visits to the barbershop or salon and referring new customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep records of your customers’ names, phone numbers, email addresses, birthdays, anniversaries etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Send them hair and beauty tips via SMS, WhatsApp or email and remember to send best wishes on their special days (birthdays and anniversaries).\n",
    "\n",
    "And when a customer has skipped a visit to your salon, call to check up on them and try to find out why they have been away. \n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of customer engagement and care always guarantees an addiction to your services!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tips*\n",
    "\n",
    "-Evenings are peak hours as well as weekends and public holidays\n",
    "\n",
    "-You may consider adding an money agent business (e.g M-Pesa or Agency Bank) on the side to ensure steady supply of business\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Depending on the kind of customers you intend to target, the prices for these services can vary significantly. If you set up shop in a relatively poor neighbourhood, price is likely to a key decision factor for the kind of customers you will attract. \n",
    "\n",
    "Middle-income and rich customers may not usually bother about prices as long as the quality of service they get is superb.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are quite a number of ways to make money in the barbershop and hair salon business. The most popular of these include:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Popular products sold by salons include: shampoo, daily and deep treatment conditioners, hair styling products such as mousse, gel, pomades and other specialty hair products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retailing professional hair products is an important strategy for retaining clients and making additional profits.\n",

    "\n",
    "These are usually high-paying customers who are unable, due to time, physical or social constraints, to visit the salon. \n",

    "\n",
    "Satisfied customers become foot soldiers, evangelists and advocates for your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is amazing how many of your satisfied customers will go to great lengths to promote, convince, protect and defend your business outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word-of-mouth is so effective and powerful that many successful business rely solely on this method to advertise and market their products and services. Network marketing businesses are a good example.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how exactly can your small business grow an army of passionate customers who will use word-of-mouth advertising to your advantage?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I have a couple of ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most important step is to *sell a product or service that really works and provides great value to anybody who uses them*. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a product or service delivers on its promise and does more than what it says, it’s a winner!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people buy products or services to solve a problem or satisfy a need. Nothing will make a customer happier and more satisfied than getting a product that makes a very challenging problem go away. \n",
    "\n",
    "They will scream your name from the mountain tops!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Great customer experience.* Most times, it doesn’t really matter how large or deep-pocketed your competition is. You can grow a successful business on great customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "People like to buy products and services from businesses that treat them with respect. People love to be given attention and treated well and will always return to enjoy that beautiful experience again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t forget, customers spend their hard-earned money on your products. Don’t you think they deserve a big “Thank you’ with a wide smile on your face? \n",
    "\n",
    "People hardly forget a great customer experience and will happily tell other people about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Give your customers a reason to advertise and market your business.* Sometimes, word-of-mouth advertising doesn’t come automatically; you have to encourage, motivate or incentivize your customers to do it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start a referral or reward program for your existing customers. The more people they refer to you, the more free products, services and discounts they will enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward should be large enough to trigger their interest and make them take action. It’s a win-win method that always works.\n",
    "\n",
    "I once helped a friend of mine create a loyalty and referral program for her barbershop and beauty salon business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way it works is simple. All existing customers were registered and given a unique code. Whenever they spend money in the shop, it increases the total amount they have spent to date. If this total reaches a certain level, they are awarded certain discounts for all the services they pay for.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were four levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum) with increasing rewards. The results were amazing! \n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every customer was referring their family, friends, neighbours and total strangers to the salon to spend money under their code thereby increasing their totals and making them reach the Gold and Platinum levels faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the same strategy successful companies and businesses are using to get more customers and recurring customers.\n",

    "\n",
    "The world of business changes frequently. For instance, some time back the coolest business to do was that of “Simu Ya Jamii”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many people invested in it as there were decent profits to be earned.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, today the business is no longer doing well because most customers eventually bought their own mobile phones and the needs of the market changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warren Edward Buffett (one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world today) teaches us that if you want to survive in business you have to keep evolving.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1936 Buffet started off selling chewing gum, a few years later he was selling coca cola drinks… by age 17 he noticed that there were bigger opportunities in opening a Kinyozi and pin-ball gaming business. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the time he was 19 he saw opportunities in stock trading and knew it was time to move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise for you, you should always be prepared to change your tact to suit changing times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t just start a Kinyozi and switch off your brain… keep advancing your Kinyozi idea and combine it with your newly learned experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way you will keep evolving and no amount of change will push you out of business!\n",
    "\n",
    "Also re-invest at least 50% of your profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most small business owners start out by pocketing whatever the business earns, they think that any profit generated by the business is their salary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "They never think of re-inventing, upgrading or growing their business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how one businessman re-invested in his blogging business between 2018 and 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "2018 – Launched the blog and earned Ksh.500,000 that year through Google Adsense, sponsored posts and affiliated ads. Recognizing the potential of the business, he re-invested Ksh.160,000 that year in re-designing the blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "2019 – The business brought him Ksh.900,000 and again he re-invested Ksh.450,000 on traffic generating tactics e.g Facebook ads, sponsoring contests and another re-design.\n",
    "\n",
    "2020 – By this time his business had started taking off, and he earned Ksh.1,500,000 that year. Once again, he re-invested heavily this time hiring freelance writers to beef up his blog content and developers to enhance the blog’s design. \n",
    "\n",
    "He also purchased adverts to drive in more traffic and spent more money on web-hosting to accommodate a growing number of readers who came to his blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "2021 – All of those investments began to pay dividends and so he was in a position to hire one full-time employee. The blogging company made Ksh.3.5 million and again he spent Ksh.1.7 on recommendation sites such as Outbrain, Taboola and Facebook Ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "2022 – This year he has projected to bring at least Ksh.5 Million and he says he will now re-invest in developing the design of the blog, more Facebook adverts and even create a new mobile app. \n",
    "\n",
    "He will also hire a full-time content editor. This way he will have enough time to specialize on growing his company rather than creating content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-investment is the most important lesson we can learn from this article. \n",
    "\n",
    "When Warren Buffett invested in chewing gums he did not stop there, he went ahead and brought in some Coke products. In addition, when he opened his Kinyozi business he decided to add a unique flavor to it by bringing in a few pinball tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "And then not long after that he re-invested in stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the way to do business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep re-investing, keep expanding, keep exploring to adapt to changing times.\n",

    "08/04/2022, 3:28 pm - +254 742 304047: *CONSULTANCY BUSINESSES YOU CAN START IN KENYA*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you start a consultancy business, you will be seeking to sell one thing to your clients – knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you are skilled in matters of planning a wedding then you can start a wedding consultancy firm. If you have excellent social media skills you can start a social media consultancy firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, if you are a good goat farmer, dating specialist, cook, security person, lawyer, doctor, engineer, IT professional or environmentalist etc. the doors are wide open for you to engage in consultancy business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what you need to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1.Your Knowledge, Your Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not start a consultancy firm in a field you are not 100% comfortable with. The kind of knowledge you offer is what sets your business apart from the competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you appear knowledgeable and helpful in the eyes of your clients then definitely they are going to give you more business. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you continuously give them half-baked information without much research to back it then they are going to leave you for someone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore imperative to be knowledgeable and experienced in your particular niche beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2: Specialize and Perfect*\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t cast your net too wide. Start with a small, super-specific niche and gradually build your profile from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, it would not be wise to start a combination of PR/ Environment Research/ History of Kenya/ Car Import Consultancy Firm as this might send a signal that you are not focused. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it is naturally difficult to keep track of new developments in multiple industries at a go.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if it is goat farming, let it be goat farming consultancy. If it is environment matters, let it be just that. Specialization will make it easier for your clients to trust you.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3: Invest in Good Networks*\n",
    "\n",
    "Networking is key in consultancy business since most clients come in through referrals. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure stable flow of demand for your services  make sure you start building your networks early enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invest in a few business cards and keep distributing them to your potential market. Host a few events (these could be free events and seminars), in your area of consultancy to strengthen the bond with your target audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "As word about your consultancy services spreads out, your business will gradually gain a footing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4: Invest in an Office*\n",
    "\n",
    "Although physical offices are not mandatory in this business, it is important to have a reputable location where you can refer some of your clients to in case they need further consultations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of such a location can make you seem like a fly by night warrior who is out to make some quick cash and then disappear into thin air.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t have the capital to invest in a new office then you can consider sub-letting.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5: Blog About It*\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing beats blogging when it comes to establishing one’s online authority in a particular area of life. \n",
    "\n",
    "A blog makes it easier to establish a bond with your online clients. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, those looking for your services via search engines such as Google can find you easily through your optimized articles. \n",
    "\n",
    "No matter the type of consultancy you are embarking on, having a blog to connect with your audience is highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also remember to create a YouTube channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples of Consultancy Firms One Can Start in Kenya*\n",

    "Approval from relevant bodies (e.g. Kenya Medical Practitioners & Dentist Board, Law Society of Kenya etc.) and Business KRA PIN\n",

    "\n",
    "AGPO Certification – This is important if you’ll be applying for Government Tenders\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cost*\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of starting varies depending on the type of services you want to offer. It costs more to start a consultancy firm in a professional field (e.g medicine and law) as compared to fields such as social media consultancy, etiquette management and fashion etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can expect to incur more expenses at start as you register and market your business. As your business gains ground, the cost of operation may reduce since consultancy firms don’t require a long list of inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is this the right business for me?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This business is ideal for people who have garnered substantial knowledge in a particular field of life and would like to share it with the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you are a great cook, musician, artist, teacher, banker, hotelier, farmer, tailor, IT person, writer, poet etc and you feel that you have sufficient expertise to share with the world then this is just the right kind of business to think about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, like any other business, a consultancy firm takes time to establish. You need to be extra patient and cautious about quality of your services to win over the hearts of your potential market.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pizza is among the most popular foods in Kenya. If you want to start a Pizzeria, you are definitely on the right path since it has a profit margin. \n",
    "\n",
    "With most people having tight schedules and busy routines, they rarely have time to prepare meals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pizza happens to be one of the favorite fast foods people buy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Peninah Ntong’ondu used to work at Pizza Inn, starting out as a cashier and, within four years, rose to become a manager at one of its outlets in Nairobi’s central business district.\n",
    "\n",
    "She was later hired by an international hotel in Westlands as a manager but quit the job  to pursue entrepreneurship, choosing to do what she knew best — making pizza.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms Ntong’ondu, is the founder of Queens Pizza Deliveries, a home-based company which prepares and delivers the popular delicacy to customers in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, she makes between eight and 10 pizzas every day, raking in at least Sh.150,000 a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I work alone every day of the week. We deliver the pizzas to customers at their homes and offices,” Ms Ntong’ondu said when we visited her house in Buruburu.\n",
    "\n",
    "“On certain days, I get bulk orders of even 35 pizzas and hire two ladies to help me out. In such cases, we offer extra catering services to the clients including providing paper plates and serving them at no extra cost.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms Ntong’ondu says she started the business with about Sh.200,000, money she used to register the company, buy a small oven as well as market the venture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queens Pizza’s menu includes 10 varieties including Hawaiian, Mexican Mince, Sausage Pizza and Spicy Chilli Chicken, among others, whose recipes she thought up herself.\n",
    "\n",
    "She sells her pizzas for between Sh.350 and Sh.750 — slightly lower than her established competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms Ntong’ondu says she owes her current business successes to her former jobs, noting that she will forever be grateful for the opportunity despite now being their competitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Whenever I got a chance (at Pizza Inn), I learned something new about the business including making the dough, laying toppings and use various herbs and ingredients before my peers started work,” she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Furthermore, the managerial position at the fast-food outlet and at the hotel gave me the opportunity to learn more about business. The opportunity was priceless.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She plans on expanding her business, hoping to open a fast-food restaurant in Buruburu after which she will also increase her pizza varieties. \n",
    "\n",
    "“I have a budget of things that I need to buy to enable me run a restaurant. I have managed to purchase some but I am yet to secure a commercial oven,” she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I need approximately Sh.950,000 to open the restaurant in Buruburu and I hope to strike a deal with an investor.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms Ntong’ondu’s lowest moment in her business was when her mother passed away a few months after she set up the business. She says the bereavement almost saw her fold the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "She went into depression and stayed away from the business for four months. But she eventually picked herself up and reopened the business, making a personal pledge to make her mother proud.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conduct a Market Research*\n",
    "\n",
    "Conducting market research is important before starting any business because it helps you to write a business plan. Research your key competitors and find out what they do so you can do it differently and better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, identify who your potential target customers are and the kind of pizza they prefer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, talk to people who have been in the business and know what challenges they have encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Write a Pizza Business Plan*\n",
    "\n",
    "To start a successful pizza business, you need a good business plan. Putting down ideas on a paper about your business will help you launch your business with much ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to include in your business plan include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A description of your pizza business\n",
    "\n",
    "*Startup capital and the source of funds\n",

    "\n",
    "*A marketing and sales plan\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cost of Starting Pizza Business in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of starting a pizza business depends on the size and type of pizza business you want to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can start a delivery business, dine-in, take-out or take and bake pizza business. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need approximately Ksh.200,000 to start one. The startup capital will go into getting the necessary licenses, business registration, and buying basic equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Identify a Good Business Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding a strategic location for your Pizza business is very crucial. You need to find a place that is easily accessible to your customers; preferably a busy town or a marketplace. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can start a pizza business from your home then make deliveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get the Required Equipment*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need equipment to start and run your pizza business. The bulk of your equipment will also depend on the size of your business.\n",

    "10/04/2022, 11:10 pm - +254 742 304047: *WITH THE COST OF FUEL SKYROCKETING IN KENYA, HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF STARTING A BIODIESEL BUSINESS IN KENYA?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you visited a restaurant lately to grab a fried chicken bite? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, next time you go to any fast-food joint make sure you ask the cooks what they do with the used oil. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most probably they will tell you they usually throw it away. \n",
    "\n",
    "What a waste!\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know that you can actually convert this waste into Bio-diesel and sell it at a premium price?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the reason I am telling you about this relatively new idea in Kenya (and Africa at large) is because I came across a success story of a young gentleman from Lusaka Zambia on CNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "The young man has converted his small backyard into a refinery of sorts and he now makes Ksh.1,500,000 per month. \n",
    "\n",
    "He is creating employment and helping his country achieve its green energy goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why can’t our very own talented young men and women take up this idea and replicate it locally? \n",
    "\n",
    "It is very easy to make bio-diesel. \n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to collect the used frying oil from the local restaurants and you are ready to make your millions as you help the country switch to renewable energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What Is Bio Diesel?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Biodiesel is a renewable type of diesel that can be created from the oil we use to cook food with. Yes, think of Golden fry, Fresh Fry or any other cooking oil we use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, bio-diesel is a more reliable source of energy than crude oil diesel. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can sell it to Matatus, generator owners, lorry drivers, poshomill operators, tractor owners, combine harvesters, small cars and the list is endless.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step One: Learn How to Make Bio-Diesel*\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably are thinking that you need to have a PhD in Chemistry or Petroleum Science to produce a bucketful of ready-to-use biodiesel. But that’s not correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "Making biodiesel is simple provided you understand the fundamentals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here I have picked one 7 minute Youtube tutorial that I have found to be simple and easy to follow. If you are a curious person (I believe you are) take a few minutes to watch it using the link below.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://youtu.be/9-SaPRccSDE \n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Two: Get The Ingredients*\n",
    "\n",
    "Okey, here we go. \n",
    "\n",
    "You only need three ingredients to make this oil. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first ingredient is used cooking oil which I am sure you can find at your nearest restaurant for free or at a small cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second ingredient is methanol which is sold by companies like Marty Enterprises (Nakuru, Kenya), Desbro (Industrial Area, NBI, Kenya), Kenya Lab Supply (Kirinyaga Road), Manigate (Kijabe Street). The price is Ksh.2,400 per 2.5 liters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third and last ingredient you will need is sodium hydroxide, (this you can find in the same shops where methanol is sold) and it goes for Ksh.1,200 per 500grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Three: Create Your Product*\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a sample product using the skills you have learnt in the youtube video tutorial I shared above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Test it first yourself and then market it to your friends first. \n",
    "\n",
    "I know you may be tempted to compete with your nearest Petrol Station, especially if you live in a place where fuel energy is scarce. But we highly recommend you start small to test the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Four: Go Full Commercial*\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, the more you get accepted by your test market, the greater your chances of success you will get. \n",
    "\n",
    "At that point you can buy more sophisticated equipment (using the money you will have earned from your maiden sales) and go fully commercial.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Five: Start Manufacturing Soap*\n",
    "\n",
    "The same ingredients used for making bio-diesel are the same that are used to make bar soaps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you and I know that there is market for soap and that the profit margins are quite good – but that’s a story for another day.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will require less than Ksh.50,000 to proceed up to Step three. From that point it will be easy to scale up the business using the entrepreneurship skills that we have been training you on all along in our PROFITABLE BUSINESS IDEAS WhatsApp group.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Zambian case study is anything to go by, then a conservative of over Ksh.200,000 per month would be a fair bet for a small start-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of entrepreneurs in this world: product creators and resellers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Product creators are the ones who call the shots. They create a product, name the price and set their profit margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reseller on the other hand prefer to thrive in other people’s ideas and so they only end up earning a small commission at the very end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with Africa is that we have too many resellers and too few product creators. And that’s why if you go to our supermarket stores today, most of the products you will find are either made in China, USA, Germany or India.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as we have seen in this brief article, you (yes you) can be the next product creator in your country if you start your own bio-diesel plant today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our Business Marketing Training to learn brilliant marketing strategies that can make your business more profitable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Do you know somebody who has all these brilliant and amazing business ideas that would make your head spin?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best things I love about my work is people. I meet a lot of interesting people – in person and over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea junkies are typically smart and intelligent people. It doesn’t take too long to figure this out. \n",
    "\n",
    "All you need is a few minutes of conversation with them and you will realize just how creative their minds really are. \n",
    "\n",
    "They can analyze a market opportunity in a second, and reveal several interesting insights. The really committed ones have a notebook that contains a long list of business ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their ‘beautiful’ minds, the biggest problem with idea junkies is they live inside their heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all the beautiful ideas they possess, there is very little action to back it up. \n",
    "\n",
    "And because they hardly take action, idea junkies actually never start a business. \n",
    "\n",
    "What a big waste!\n",
    "\n",
    "Having all that knowledge and amazing ideas and not doing anything about them is horrifying, and should be classified as a crime. \n",
    "\n",
    "After all, a lot of great ideas that could change the world are locked up in their heads and they are doing nothing about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I suffer quite a bit from the ‘idea junkie syndrome’. And the way I fight it is to challenge myself to take action on my ideas, no matter how little these actions are. \n",
    "\n",
    "By taking action, I actually see that some of these ideas may actually not work in real life, while some other ideas just metamorphose into something totally different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real entrepreneurs are not usually the smartest people in the room. What makes them different is action. They always take action.\n",
    "\n",
    "And when that idea becomes a huge business success, guess who’s the first person to say: “I had that idea first, a long time ago!”?\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s right, idea junkies will always regret their inaction. Ideas are great, but they are just not enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you an idea junkie?\n",
    "\n",
    "If YES is your answer, then NOW is the time to put those great ideas in your brain into action.\n",

    "\n",
    "What comes to your mind when you hear about the matatu business? \n",
    "\n",
    "Do you see opportunities, chaos or both? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, irrespective of your perception of the industry, the fact of the matter is that this is not a business for the faint-hearted.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a bumpy ride but if you are ready to learn the ropes; then there’s nothing that can stop you from conquering it (business-wise). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you have to roll up your sleeves and get ready for a ride of a lifetime. \n",
    "\n",
    "A ride that can take you places if you play by the rules but one that can easily leave you bankrupt if you miscalculate your steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "With many people relying on public transport to commute, the matatu business is a lucrative industry to invest in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most people commit to and from their workplaces using public transport services. Also, students use public transport to go to school, making it a lucrative business.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is high competition and you need to be different to make it in the matatu business. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are more customers during rush hours like in the morning and evening when people are going and coming from their workplaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I will show you how you can start a matatu business in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "*How to Start a Matatu Business in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "Matatu business is capital intensive and it requires proper planning and market research before venturing into it. If you want to invest in the matatu business, this is what you need to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Buy the Right Matatu Vehicle*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a durable vehicle with a strong engine to start the matatu business. \n",
    "\n",
    "The least startup capital for a matatu business in Kenya is Ksh.1,000,000 for a second hand matatu. However, it is best if you have over Ksh.1,500,000 to cater for other expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can opt to buy a new or second-hand matatu for your matatu business. It is advisable to buy a new car if you have enough capital. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second-hand vehicles sometimes are problematic, requiring frequent and expensive repairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most expensive spare part is the engine, and when it gets to the end of its life, there’s nothing you can do about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Always have some amount in your account sufficient to purchase a good ex-japan engine just in case the need arises. An average engine costs Ksh.300,000 and above.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much is a New 14 Seater Matatu in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can invest in a 14 seater matatu or a 33 seater matatu. A brand new 14 seater matatu price is around Ksh.2,500,000, while a brand new 33 seater matatu will cost you roughly Ksh.4,500,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Toyota and Isuzu are the leading brands for matatus in Kenya you need to consider. Make sure to do the necessary paperwork when purchasing a matatu.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Brand the Car*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to brand a car with the latest graphics and trends in the market. Most public transport users prefer to use flamboyant matatus. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to blend colors and graphics well so that they are adaptive for passengers of all ages. Moha Graffics and Fabricators offer quality matatu branding.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Install Music System*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to also invest in a quality music system to entertain passengers. You do not need a loud and noisy music system but a moderate one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Older adults hate too loud music. As such, ensure that you can control the music well so that it is not too loud.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hire Trustworthy Driver and Conductor*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to hire a driver and a tout of high integrity and trustworthy. You do not want to hire people who will hide some of your daily earnings and expect you to pay them. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to avoid such problems is by joining a matatu Sacco.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a matatu Sacco, passengers pay while boarding the vehicle at the bus stop. Matatu owners get their monies from the Sacco. \n",
    "\n",
    "Saccos are involved in the hiring of the driver and conductor, relieving the matatu owner of the challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can install a GPS tracker to monitor the number of trips the matatu makes each day. You can also use it to ensure that the matatu only plies in the route it is authorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Secure Licenses and Insurance*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have bought a matatu, you need to insure it with the right insurance coverage. It is best to go for comprehensive car insurance to ensure that you are fully covered, even against liabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shop around to get the best car insurance with the best terms and prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to take your car to the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) for inspection. They check whether a vehicle is roadworthy and if it meets all the safety measures like safety belts, speed governors and fire extinguishers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your car's driver needs to have a driver's license, certificate of good conduct, and PSV license. You can get the certificate of good conduct from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. Make sure your car meets all the necessary regulations and safety measures before going to the road.\n",
    "\n",

    "Joining a matatu Sacco is one of the surest way to succeed in the matatu business. With a Sacco, you can keep your vehicle expenditure low. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is challenging to excel in the matatu business without a Sacco. Many passengers prefer to use matatus registered with Saccos since they can report the driver or tout in case of any issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are rogue touts that are rude and violent. As such, you can avoid the challenges of having to deal with issues like overloading. \n",
    "\n",
    "Saccos are also useful when you want to manage your finances well. Many matatu owners lose a lot of money to untrustworthy conductors that do not remit all the monies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before joining a matatu sacco, get to know their requirements first. The requirements to join a matatu sacco in Kenya vary from one Sacco to the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Matatu Expenses*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to cater to the matatu expenses like insurance, fuels and repairs. You need to keep good records of the matatu earnings and expenses to determine whether you are making any profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most times, the police and the county council authorities are expenses to your matatu business. They impose expensive fines for minor traffic offenses. Therefore, make sure to comply with traffic rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much Does a 14 Seater Matatu Make in a Day? *\n",
    "\n",
    "How much does a matatu earn per day? On average, a 14 seater matatu makes around Ksh.3,500 in a day. However, depending on route and other factors, a 14 seater matatu can make more than that. \n",
    "\n",
    "The route your vehicle plies may determine how much you make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Profitable routes around the city of Nairobi have been identified as: Mwiki – Town, Wangige – Town, Rongai – Town, Kikuyu – Town, Embakasi – Jogoo Road – Town and Kitengela – Town.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some routes that are quite difficult to operate in mainly because of cartels include Kayole and Dandora.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is Matatu Business Profitable in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The matatu business is profitable with the right approach, staff and car. In a busy day, a matatu business can generate revenues of up to Ksh.4,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having an honest crew like the conductor and driver is a sure way to make profits since you will not be losing your earnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new car won't require frequent and expensive repairs and maintenance hence saving you lots of money. \n",
    "\n",
    "The route your car is commuting also determines your daily earnings. If it is a busy route, then you are sure to make good profits.\n",

    "*Wear and tear \n",
    "\n",
    "*Traffic jams \n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "When starting a matatu business in Kenya, you need to consider daily running costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these costs include fueling, wages, insurance, repairs and maintenance and fines when the vehicle is impounded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Always make sure that at all times, your insurance cover is up to date. If possible, get a comprehensive insurance policy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Matatu businesss is a bumpy ride but if you are ready to learn the ropes; then there’s nothing that can stop you from conquering it (business-wise).\n",

    "\n",
    "I encounter this kind of ‘entrepreneur’ a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Victim is the guy who has a beautiful idea and should have built it into an amazing business but, according to him, there are a lot of people and things that are hell-bent on frustrating him:\n",
    "\n",
    "The government, for example, won’t provide electricity that he desperately needs to power the factory. \n",

    "All his friends just don’t get it and aren’t smart enough to support his brilliant business idea.\n",

    "Some Victims could go as far as blaming their parents for their poor family background. \n",
    "\n",
    "They blame God for not sending a ‘divine intervention’. \n",
    "\n",
    "They blame the weather, the neighbours, their spouse and children.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Victim blames everything and everybody.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the victim fails to realise is that he’s actually making excuses, but masking them as blame, complaints and criticism. \n",
    "\n",
    "As far as he’s concerned, he’s the victim who deserves to be given a chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Entrepreneurs don’t wait to be given a chance. They take a chance!\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, due to the challenges we face in Africa, a lot of our young and aspiring entrepreneurs have become victims. \n",

    "\n",
    "Rabbit farming has taken the Kenyan market by storm over the last few years; but like with any other upcoming business idea in Kenya, farmers are encountering a couple of challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to that, i did some research on this agri-business opportunity. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to put down a short informative article to help young farmers (as well as buyers) who want to venture into rabbit farming in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Types of Breeds That Do Well in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI), there are three (3) breeds of rabbits in Kenya; California, Chinchilla and New Zealand white. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flemish Giant is also quite popular around the country. Chinchilla is a grey-brown breed and is preferred because it has a large mature weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most rabbits reach maturity in 5 months and achieve slaughter weight in just 3 months. Rabbit’s reproduce 3 to 4 times annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Zealand and Californian are popular because they can be relied on for fur as well as meat. Chinchilla is preferred for meat because of its large mature size.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Benefits of Rabbit Keeping*\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the high turnover that is characteristic of this field of business, rabbits have numerous benefits. First, their meat is categorized as white meat. Rabbit meat is white, high quality, easily digestible and low fat. It has low cholesterol and high protein compared to most other meat. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rabbit meat provides low calories per kilogram of meat consumed than pork, turkey, chicken or beef.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rabbit urine is used both as an insecticide and fertilizer. Their skin and fur can be used in the manufacture of fashion items. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rabbit droppings serve as tilapia food for those with ponds. A 20kg sack goes for between Ksh.50 and Ksh.200. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some local agrochemical companies have shown interest on Rabbit droppings but inadequate supply has always proved to be a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "{Rabbit meat has 20.8% protein as compared to lamb meat which contains 15.7% and beef 16.3%}\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cost of Rabbit Farming*\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of rearing rabbits depends on the type of system you use. Feeds are a major cost because rabbits consume about 25 grams of pellets per day. \n",
    "\n",
    "This translates to 2.25Kg in 90 days. On average 2Kg of rabbit pellets cost between Ksh.90 and Ksh.150. These feeds can be easily found in local agrovet shops and supermarkets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can feed them on vegetables. An average rabbit feeds on 2 leaves of sukumawiki (Kales) per day. You may also feed them on carrots. Aside from the cost of feeds, you should also add other costs as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cost of labour (constructing rabbit hutches)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Depreciation of hutches\n",
    "\n",
    "*Transport to the nearest rabbit market\n",
    "\n",
    "*Regions Where Rabbit Business Thrives*\n",
    "\n",
    "Rabbits can be kept in virtually any part of Kenya provided they are housed properly and protected from predators. The Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries will be able to furnish you with specific information like – where to source the right species and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kindly visit your nearest ministry offices to inquire more on requirements for starting up rabbit farming in your area.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Where to find Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding market for Rabbits has proven to be a challenge to most farmers in Kenya. To some extent this can be blamed on poor flow of information from the sellers to the buyers (and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, there are two different avenues that you can use to sell your Rabbit products. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can sell through local companies that have established themselves as an authority in this line of business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rabbit Republic, Mombasa Road, next to kenchick, Athi River, 0704124499 is one such company. Benida Foods at Kahawa W Station Rd, Nairobi, 0722 907984 is yet another example of a company that deals with rabbit marketing in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way to market your rabbits is through direct marketing. In that case you would have to visit big hotels and research centers looking for market. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to approach supermarkets in your area and request them to sell your stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "To market rabbits you need certification by the Veterinary services department (MALF), Kenya Bureau of Statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "One place to find market for rabbit meat is at local hotels. Most 5 star hotels are looking for consistent suppliers. You only need to visit several of these hotels in your area and talk to them about your farming business. Rabbit meat retails at a price range of Ksh.500 and Ksh.700 per kilogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from the Export Promotion Council (EPC) shows that demand for rabbit meat globally has not been fulfilled. For this reason, farmers with less than 100 rabbits are being urged to form groups at the county level in order to strategize on how best to supply other countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally;*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many factors to consider before you venture into Rabbit farming in Kenya. I recommend that you carry out thorough research before you rush to invest in any kind of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our Business Marketing Training to learn brilliant marketing strategies that can make your business more profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called *BUSINESS MARKETING TRAINING*\n",

    "Sometimes back I was somewhere and noticed there was a sales man marketing his herbal product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without thinking twice, I payed a close attention to how he was pitching his product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you knew it, I had pulled out my phone and started jotting down some notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yea, I turned that into a classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was jotting down his strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, I noticed that he told many stories that were related to the benefits of his product.\n",
    "\n",
    "I as well noticed that he (tactically) used those stories as testimonials for his product.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also noticed that he spoke few good things about his business/company (to build credibility).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other things I noticed about this smart sales man was that he gave discounts (humans love discounts) and he tried to place some “scarcity strategy” somewhere along his pitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the above and few other things are what I learned from the street sales man.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We live in a beautiful country indeed. Our potential for agri-business is immense, our land is fertile and our people are hard workers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to a fast growing demand for fresh grocery, demand for agricultural products such as watermelons has grown exponentially over the last few years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today i want to share some important tips on How To Grow Your Ksh.40,000 Into Ksh.400,000 In A 100 Days with watermelon farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "*#1: Get the Seeds*\n",
    "\n",
    "High quality seeds are available at Kenya Seeds Company and Simlaw Seeds Company outlets. At the moment 500 grams of seeds is retailing at Ksh.12,500 and it can serve up to 1 acre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that because watermelon produce large vines, you need to leave a space of at least 1.5 metres between rows. This leafy crop should be grown away from any shade so that it receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "*#2: Choose the Right Variety*\n",
    "\n",
    "The variety of watermelon you choose can determine what profit you are going to reap from your investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Mr. Robert Musyoki, a variety known as Sweet Rose is the best bet for first time farmers since it is highly resistant to diseases and pests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other varieties that are in high demand in Kenya include: Sugar-Baby, Jubilee and Congo.\n",
    "\n",
    "*#3: How Long to Maturity?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Watermelons normally reach maturity in 80 to 100 days. To check if your fruits are ready you only need to turn them to see if they have a yellow patch on the part that lies against the ground. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to check for maturity would be by thumping the fruits – you should expect to hear a dull noise from a ripe one.\n",
    "\n",
    "*#4: Can I Plant Watermelons in My Home Area?*\n",
    "\n",
    "“Watermelon is adapatable to a wide range of environments” said Robert Musyoki. In general watermelons grow well in mid-hot coastal areas and dry plains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example of such places: Machakos, Embu, Kirinyaga, Loitoktok, Garissa, Isiolo, Kerio Valley and some parts of Meru. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) this crop can also perform well in areas with black cotton soil (such as Kitengela) if planted under drip irrigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*#5: Challenges to Watch Out For*\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any other business, watermelon farming has its fair share of challenges. According to Dr. John McOpiyo (a one-time Watermelon farmer) says that finding the right pesticides, and fungicide is always a challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "He narrated to us how he sprayed his farm with wrong chemicals only to lose all his crops. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would recommend seeking advice from an extension officer before applying any pesticides or fungicides to watermelons.\n",
    "\n",
    "*#6: How Much You Need (1 acre farm budget)*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Seeds – Ksh.12,500\n",
    "\n",
    "*Labour – Ksh.10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ploughing and weeding – Ksh.10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*50 KG DAP Fertilizer – Ksh.2,500\n",
    "\n",
    "An acre of land can produce 45,000 Kilograms. Each Kilogram retails at a farm-gate price of Ksh.10 – Ksh.15. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, we are talking about a return of about Ksh.450,000 minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How former watchman and college dropout youth found a soft landing in Watermelon Farming*\n",
    "\n",
    "Raised by a single parent, Zachariah Onchuri is one of those few youths who have gone through various challenges in their hustles through the persistence for success has borne them fruits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Zack, as famously known by his friends, was forced out of college in 2009 when he could not pay his school fees given his mother who is his only parent, he could depend on was unable to pay his fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "His hustle as a ‘mutura’ seller in Eldoret Town near Elgon View College where he was taking his journalism course could also not continue as the town ‘askaris’ were always on his case due to lack of business permit. \n",
    "\n",
    "When it became unbearable, he dropped out of college, left his home in Sotik, Bomet County for Kilifi Town after a friend of his called him over to join him in a security job.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I had no choice, I found myself being a night watchman in the coastal town, a job which could earn me Ksh.3,500 a month,” said Zack.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the day, he could also get involved in hawking fruits such as watermelon, oranges and pineapples at least to increase his earning, foot his bills and support his mother back at home. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for him, the fruit hawking business picked and he saw no need of continuing as a night security guard. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, he left the watchman job in May 2009 to focus on his new business. “I used to make Ksh.500 a day from watermelon sales alone as it was loved by most consumers and it would always run out of stock leaving me with nothing to sell even when the demand was still high,” said Zack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon an idea stroke his mind - farming watermelon. However, his first challenge was the lack of a farm though he could afford farm inputs from his little savings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, a young man from the Chakama location in Kilifi County whom they had become friends offered him a quarter piece of land to grow watermelon. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without any skills in commercial farming and had not thought of consulting, Zack later in September 2010 left his business in town to invest about Ksh.11,000 in watermelon farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, he lost almost the entire crop to Bacterial Fruit Blotch and Powdery Mildew, very common watermelon diseases. \n",
    "\n",
    "“At a time I was expecting my first fruits in December that year, I realized the products were still very small and unhealthy while others were withering away. There was no hope on them so I destroyed everything,” he said. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not losing hope, he hustled for a loan of Ksh.50,000 to begin afresh since his Chakama friend had accepted to let him another half an acre piece of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting his round two of watermelon farming, he had to consult the county agriculture extension officer and some experienced farmers in the area. \n",
    "\n",
    "In mid-January, he planted the fruits again using the friend’s generator water pump to draw water from Athi River which the farm was closer to water his tender crops through the dry season.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mid-March 2011, he harvested about six tonnes of watermelon which he took to markets in Malindi and Kilifi to sell by himself at Sh.40 per kilo without passing through middlemen hence making full profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "“At the end of that season I made Ksh.200,000 gross income remaining with Ksh.140,000 after expenses and this has since motivated me,” said Zack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today the young farmer has over 47 acres of land (his own and others leased) under rotation watermelon farming at Chakama and Garsen in Malindi. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For the Star Gazer, timing and perfection are all that matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "She is the kind of person who dreams about starting a business, growing it into a huge success, and becoming a celebrity entrepreneur. \n",
    "\n",
    "She dreams of becoming a serial entrepreneur, and having a vast portfolio of investments in real estate and on the stock market.\n",
    "\n",
    "When she’s successful, her kids will study at an Ivy League school. She will live in a posh part of the city and become a well-connected socialite.\n",
    "\n",
    "She doesn’t only dream at night. Her dreams are so compelling, she also dreams quite a lot during the day time too. \n",
    "\n",
    "And when she’s really in the mood, she will share these dreams with anyone who cares to listen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the Star Gazer is, she’s waiting for the perfect time to become an entrepreneur. \n",
    "\n",
    "As far as she’s concerned, the stars must align before she can make the move. \n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, she has a very demanding job and she’s very involved in other activities. She’s just not ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask her about making those dreams come true, she will say: “Someday, one day, I will start. But not now. The right time hasn’t come.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing is, ‘someday’ may never come. And frankly, I tend to believe Star Gazers are far more interested in the entertainment and fantasy that their dreams provide than actually doing anything to make them come true.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start acquiring financial education (especially in our PROFITABLE BUSINESS IDEAS Whatsapp Group and in our various Business Training groups), your eyes will start opening to money making business opportunities around you. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will start “seeing” gold you never saw before, all around you. \n",
    "\n",
    "When this starts happening, you have to be a doer, an actor, a runner not a dreamer or star gazer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurs are actors. They are not talkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be faced (or you are already being faced) with the temptation to start big or perfectly. Resist that temptation! Starting a business is rarely smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Sam Adeyemi (a Nigeria motivational speaker) said, “start where you are with what you have”, he was offering a great advice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most people understand that the best way to acquire riches is to be an entrepreneur, yet, they are still waiting. For what? For a perfect moment, great idea, huge capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to be a doer, an actor, a runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have got a business idea? Start small, with all your heart and life. \n",

    "\n",
    "“I am not going back to formal employment,” Grace Adek says. \n",
    "\n",
    "She has been selling second-hand women’s clothes since she was a university student.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I would buy 30 extra dresses to sell to my schoolmates every time I went shopping for myself,” she says. “I would buy the dresses for Sh.50 to Sh.100, then sell them for Sh.300 to Sh.600 bob.”\n",
    " \n",
    "Four years ago she quit her job as a pharmaceuticals marketer to pursue her mitumba business fulltime. She was 32 at the time. At the time, Grace had been dabbling in the business part-time while she worked her day job.\n",
    " \n",
    "Now, Grace purchases clothes worth hundreds of thousands a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Every week I buy stock worth between Sh.200,000 and Sh.300,000. I make a profit of between Sh.100,000 to Sh.150,000. I make Sh.20,000 on a good day and at least Sh.5,000 in a bad one.”\n",
    " \n",
    "In the meantime, costs are low; Grace runs her business online so she has no rent to pay. She has a Facebook page with 29,000 likes, and it is where her customers shop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides two motorbikes and their drivers to deliver her orders, there are no other costs.\n",
    " \n",
    "The second-hand apparel market is a money-spinner – for everyone involved. Along the import and distribution chain, profit margins more than double as the selling costs dwindle. \n",
    " \n",
    "Anyone who’s in it makes a killing. And there is a huge market for them, too. According to Ipsos survey, 62 per cent of middle and lower income urban Kenyans buy mitumba.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is never a fixed amount of revenue that you are expected to get.\n",
    " \n",
    "With mitumba business, you can make a profit of more than 50% of the buying price with a suitable location with many customers like near colleges, in market centers or on social media. \n",
    "\n",
    "The startup cost is low and you can start with little capital and grow your business over time. \n",
    " \n",
    "Its expenses are less since you only need to pay for licenses and permits. You can opt to sell from a store, open market centers or online.\n",
    " \n",
    "My friend Alex is one of a kind. When I met him, almost five years ago, I was by then living in Thika. If you have been in Thika or any other town for that matter, you know how busy the streets are especially in the evenings, lined up with hawkers merchandizing all kinds of goodies.\n",
    " \n",
    "Alex was one of them and at that time he used to sell secondhand clothes commonly known as mitumba. He would wake up very early in the morning to go to Gikomba to buy stock.\n",
    " \n",
    "He no longer sells mitumba but he is the proud owner of two majorly stocked electronics shops in Nairobi and Kikuyu.\n",
    " \n",
    "He now imports his things from other countries and even has links with the likes of Sayona and Samsung where he gets his stock from.\n",
    " \n",
    "Most people like Alex, have used Mitumba business as a catapult to something better.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you don’t have a lot of capital to start a business, I strongly believe that a mitumba business is one of the most profitable businesses you can venture into.\n",
    " \n",
    "Running a successful mitumba retail business requires you to be flexible. Adapt to seasonal changes and be willing to adjust your prices now and then. \n",
    "\n",
    "The items you will get will never be the same and you will need strategies on how to make enough from them.\n",
    " \n",
    "Revenue is influenced by:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Type of items.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Quality of items.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Price at which you purchase the items.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Price at which you sell the items.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Your location.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Target market.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. Expenses.\n",
    " \n",
    "Most people shy to venture into mitumba business. They think that it’s saturated but there are a lot of profits in it. \n",
    " \n",
    "Surprisingly if you have Ksh.5,000, you can start selling mitumba clothes.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Ksh.5,000 starting capital in this kind of business, you can be assured of at least 500 shillings in profit at the end of the day. \n",
    " \n",
    "Isn’t it better than just sitting at home waiting for someone to notice your application letter on their desk?\n",

    "16/04/2022, 12:01 pm - +254 742 304047: *ARE YOU SELLING THE WRONG WAY?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most small business owners we help aren’t getting the sale or even maximizing the sale because they sell wrongly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than focusing on the advantages of their products over the competition or the benefits to their customer for buying this product or service, they focus on the features of their products and services. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Buy bread here! Get hospital services at so and so address! Nunua mafuta ya taa hapa! \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s nice, but what’s in it for me as a customer? \n",
    "\n",
    "And why are you any better than the guy down the street who also sells bread? \n",
    "\n",
    "Other businesses are selling what you are selling. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example you wouldn`t write in your signboard, “buy bread here”. That`s not persuasive.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you use, “buy low-sugar, but sweet bread here”? \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you are sounding unique and persuasive. For people who know that sugar is bad for their health, you are the man.\n",
    "\n",
    "You wouldn`t want to advertise your hospital in the newspaper by saying, “get hospital services at so and so address”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, something like “we are malaria specialists. Come to our hospital at…” may be more persuasive.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am sure you get my point. Don`t tell the world about your product, hundreds of products like yours are already in the market. The only thing that can persuade people to buy from you is your Uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes back I needed some aluminum work to be done, so I called a guy whose work is fixing Aluminum. \n",
    "\n",
    "“How much will it cost me to put aluminum on this windows?” I asked the gentleman. \n",
    "\n",
    "After I explained the kind I want, he said, “That kind will cost you XXX shillings. You know, I want to give you the best because I don't want to do it the way most people do it. And you see, if it was some months ago, I would have agreed to do it with just YYY shillings (lesser price). But because those material`s cost has increased, I will need to give you the best price of XXX shillings”.\n",
    "\n",
    "That guy is a marketer! He did his negotiation perfectly well. Did you learn something?\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, as you are selling your products or services, tell people the *reason* for your price.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your product’s price has increased from what it was last month, don’t just tell people, “That bag is Ksh.2,000”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, be business wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell people, “Madam, that bag was Ksh.1,500. But due to recent importation restrictions, many of the locally produced bags have experienced hike in price. If you visit other bag stores, you will find it to be so, except for those who may want to sell you substandard bags”\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think my friend? \n",
    "\n",
    "Did you learn something? \n",
    "\n",
    "Tell people the *reason* for your higher prices. They will understand and buy from you.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are a patient investor who is willing to risk it all and wait for returns in 5 years or so, then Eucalyptus farming might just be the right business idea for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not only is this an opportunity to create some income but an avenue to help the country achieve a 10% tree cover by 2030 as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "But is there market for these trees or is it just hype as usual? \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics from the Kenya Forest Service show that Kenya imports Ksh.7 Billion worth of timber from countries like Tanzania every year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Local forests can barely sustain the nation’s demand hence the need for farmers to step in to fill up this gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eucalyptus trees in particular have a wide variety of uses including as: electricity transmission poles, props for construction industry, production of essential menthol oil, timber for furniture and fuel wood for industrial and domestic use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demand for mature Eucalyptus trees is very high in most parts of the country and this trend is expected to hold for at least the next 20 years – and herein lies a good investment opportunity for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Eucalyptus Tree Farming Business Idea in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Get A Piece of Land*\n",
    "\n",
    "Eucalyptus trees can grow in almost every part of the country (from Turkana to Central Highlands and Coastal Lowlands).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, you should purchase or lease a minimum of 1 acre piece of land. \n",
    "\n",
    "If leasing, let the lease period be at least 10 years so that you have enough time to utilize the land. An acre of land goes for as little as Ksh.300,000 (purchase) and Ksh.5,000 to Ksh.10,000 per year lease in the remote rural areas in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Prepare It*\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need to till the land but you will need to dig holes in which to plant the trees. Spacing of 1 meter in between holes and rows is recommended (but you can always talk to a forestry expert for more concise advice on this).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Obtain Seedlings*\n",
    "\n",
    "Only get seedlings from reliable outlets. For starters, you can check with your nearest KEFRI office, they have branches in Muguga, Maseno, Kitui, Nyeri, Londiani, Gede, Kakamega and Turbo. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively you can consult the Kenya Forest Service or any KFS-approved tree nursery in your area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Good seedlings retail at a price range of Ksh.20 – Ksh.30.\n",
    "\n",
    "An acre piece of land can accommodate up to 3,800 seedlings. But you can always start with as few as 3000 seedlings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Different types of Eucalyptus Species Include Grandis, Saligna, Globulus and Regnans. A forestry expert will be able to advice you on which species best suits your region. Generally Grandis is the most popular type in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4: Plant & Wait*\n",
    "\n",
    "Plant the trees at around the long-rains season and cover with enough soil. Keep animals off the young trees and if possible keep checking every few weeks to see how the farm is faring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trees are not susceptible to frequent infections; but if you spot any signs of improper growth you will need to either destroy the weak trees or consult an expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 5: Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "Market is readily available with mature unprocessed poles being bought at Ksh.3,500 per piece by processing plants which then sell to electricity suppliers in Kenya, Northern Uganda and Southern Sudan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each processed pole is then sold for Ksh.17,000 per piece. One example of a processing plant that buys eucalyptus directly from farmers is the Millennium Trading House located in Ndenderu, Limuru in Kiambu County.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Useful Tips*\n",
    "\n",
    "-Grandis Eucalyptus trees take less than 4 years to reach market maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "-A few trees may die or fail to grow properly along the way. 90% success rate would be a good estimation to start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Sometimes you can harvest the trees at only 18 months of age if you have ready market for props and posts (mostly this market comes from real estate constructions). Props go for Ksh.100 per piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Always get KFS certified seedlings. Don’t take shortcuts as you might compromise the quality of your final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will require about Ksh.150,000 to set up the farm with around 3,000 trees. You can set aside another long-term budget of Ksh.50,000 to cater for other charges that may arise in running the farm. \n",
    "\n",
    "So total investment Ksh.200,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you manage to harvest 3000 trees at full maturity (which is 4 to 5 years) and sell each unprocessed piece to a processing plant at Ksh.3,500 then you will expect Ksh.10,500,000 in sales revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is largely passive income because you don’t need to spend every day managing the farm once the trees are planted.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this world you have to make two choices. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first choice is to work hard for your money and the second choice is to let your money do the hard work for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose the former then your options are quite limited. But if you go for the latter, and think about eucalyptus farming in Kenya seriously, you will realize there’s a lot in store for you in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also we only have 2 days remaining before we start our Business Marketing Training.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For many, life in college presents an opportunity to mingle with friends and spend plenty of free time exploring various curiosity points in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the graduation day comes, though, most graduates are not prepared for whatever challenges life has to offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whether to venture into business or pursue the ever- scarce positions in formal employment suddenly becomes a dilemma.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the midst of all this confusion, some get completely lost in life – losing precious moments at the peak of their lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is to blame?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it our porous education system that falls short of equipping our learners with important skills? \n",
    "\n",
    "Is it the society that fails to create a good example to the young generation? \n",
    "\n",
    "Or is it the government which has failed to do its role? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you figure out who to blame, here are 3 mistakes that (from experience) graduates make that cause them to suffer long after completing school.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Being Picky On Careers*\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with most graduates is that they tend to “box” their minds into believing that they can only handle careers that are related to the courses and areas of specialization they undertook in campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "They think “Mmmmh, I have done accounts and so the only job I can handle is that of an accounts clerk and nothing else”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that’s where hell breaks loose because in most cases the so-called “relevant” job doesn’t come easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to link up with real life after college is to first open your mind to all opportunities that come your way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t turn down that electrician’s job simply because you are an economist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t turn down that part-time teaching job at your local secondary school just because you have graduated in Bsc. Actuarial Science. \n",
    "\n",
    "The world outside here doesn’t care so much about what you studied in class – it cares more about what you can bring to the table given the slightest opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Not Being Ready To Volunteer*\n",
    "\n",
    "That white collar job may not come easily and neither will that dream business take a couple of days to blossom. \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Out here you have to learn to sweat for success.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to kick-start your career is by volunteering your services so that you can gain relevant experience first. \n",
    "\n",
    "So beyond the 6 month internship you took as part of your course-work don’t be hesitant to clock in one more year by volunteering in some institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can look for charity organizations or start-ups and volunteer to serve. \n",
    "\n",
    "If volunteering opportunities still prove elusive, don’t hesitate to take the initiative to start something like a community based organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you can get 10 other like-minded youth and start planting trees and sensitizing the community about its importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can even start a part-time tuition class to raise the standards of learning in your area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t worry about how low on the food chain you get to start – a journey of a thousand miles starts with one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Going Back To Live With Your Parents*\n",
    "\n",
    "A story is told of an old man who was lying on his hospital bed – a long long time ago. As he was lying there recovering he noticed a wasp nest (cocoon) on the corner side of the ceiling within his room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside that nest was a young wasp that had been hatched a few weeks earlier and was now struggling to break the nest apart as it was growing big and needed to come out to start its own life. \n",
    "\n",
    "The old man upon seeing the struggles of the wasp gently got out of his bed, went to the nest and enlarged the hole making it easier for the young wasp to walk out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good news: the wasp walked out immediately to gain its freedom. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bad news: The wasp never learned to fly on its own. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its feathers never hardened and its zeal to risk floating in the air dwindled away. Soon it died. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, wasps are designed to struggle when coming out of their nests for the first time. This prepares them for the tough life out there and that’s how they eventually learn how to fly and fend for themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the old man enlarged the hole, the wasp had an easy time coming out and its wings and stamina were not properly developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moral of the story – move out of your parents’ house right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t let them make things easier for you. Go out there and fight your own battles until you learn how to fly on your own. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, you may not have all the money required to start your business and luck may not be on your side as far as finding a job that’s relevant to what you learned in campus is concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that should not put you down. Get your hustle up, stop the blame game and most importantly – swing to action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't just sit there idle. Roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also we only have 2 days remaining before we start our Business Marketing Training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called *BUSINESS MARKETING TRAINING*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this group we are going to train and teach you for 21 days brilliant marketing strategies that can make your business more profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goods and services you are selling are like the body of a car while marketing is the engine that drives the car. Sometimes a car with a bad “body”, but a good engine will outrun a car with a good “body” but a poor engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today`s business world, having a good product will not make you rich. You need to have great marketing skills\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When the Narc government took over in Kenya in 2003, free primary education in public primary schools was launched all over the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "This increased the number of pupils attending schools countrywide. As a result of this, and in addition to the increasing number of private schools, adult readers, secondary and college students, the demand for books dramatically increased in the country. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though electronic books, audio books and digital magazines have come into use, many people still enjoy buying and reading traditional, printed books.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is estimated that the government pays fees for more than 10 million pupils in primary schools and about 2.1 million students in secondary schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "A total of Sh.670 is budgeted for each primary school pupil to cater for textbooks, instructional materials and facilitation of internal examinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The demand for exercise books, text books and other stationery materials will therefore keep rising. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tells you that bookshops will remain viable businesses for many years to come. \n",
    "\n",
    "An entrepreneur can therefore greatly benefit by investing in a bookshop business. You can identify a niche market or stock a mixture of school books and other types.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "Book business has serious competition. Your location should therefore be in a place that is not already saturated with bookshops. \n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a place that has high human foot traffic. Make your bookshop business highly visible and accessible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such places are mostly found in established busy shopping malls, busy residential shopping centers and areas with high economic activities\n",
    "\n",
    "In a city like Nairobi, busy areas like River road, Tom Mboya Street, Accra Road, Latema Road, Commercial, and Tea Room are some of the strategic areas to locate a bookshop business in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "In residential areas, it is better to operate from busy streets since these areas are frequented by large numbers of people all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other towns in Kenya also have busy sections that are suitable for a bookshop business in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of your operating space will depend on your expected volume of business. It is more expensive to rent a big space therefore, clearly map out your demand and expected turnover before deciding on the size of room/premises to rent for your bookshop business. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will also depend on whether you may want to stock other stationery items such as office supplies.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Requirements*\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already talked about the space to operate your bookshop business. Other requirements will be the stock of books and shelves to stock them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bookshelves should cost you roughly Sh.20,000. You will need a well-designed stocking system fully labelled to enable you easily find the books. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need an assistant who understands the books very well. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to make a catalogue of your stocks, divided into different categories, and complete with retail prices. This will help you and/or your assistant to easily locate any book that you need to sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other requirements will be a single business permit from the county to legally operate your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Supplies*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you buy from publishers, you will need to be a member of Kenya Booksellers and Stationers Association, therefore it is advisable to join this association. \n",
    "\n",
    "To join this association, visit their offices at Shankardass House on Moi Avenue with copies of your business license, ID and PIN. \n",
    "\n",
    "Annual fee is Sh.12,500 renewable at Sh.5,000 annually. Their year runs from October to October. Note this very carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary and secondary school textbooks may form a big portion of your sales. It is therefore advisable to stock these books as a priority. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the numerous changes in our education syllabuses, as a bookshop owner, it will be in your interest to keep in close touch with the happenings in the Ministry of Education and the policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should identify the fast moving books in the area where your bookshop is located. These should be the books to give priority as you stock. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from text books, other stationery items such as exercise books, pens, note books, geometrical sets and dictionaries also move fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buying stock of books in bulk from these suppliers attracts good discounts. \n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize your costs and increase your profit margins, consider buying school textbooks books in bulk from the publishers. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should also buy exercise books and other supplies in bulk directly from the printers and other major stationery suppliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are well established, publishers will be fighting over each other to deliver books to you, mostly on credit, which is payable once the books are sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Competition*\n",
    "\n",
    "Bookshop business has stiff competition. Apart from locating in a busy and accessible point, your bookshop business setup should also differentiate itself from competitors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aggressive marketing will be crucial for survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your bookshop will be located in Nairobi, you will be competing with major established players such as Book Point on Moi Avenue, Text Book Center on Kijabe Street, Sarit Center and other major malls, Svanis on Latema and many others in supermarkets and all over town.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to reach out to clients instead of waiting for them to come to your bookshop. \n",
    "\n",
    "They may just go to your competitors since most books are standard; there is no recommended text book that can be said to be more superior. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may also stock a section for second hand books, both textbooks and novels. These have a higher margin than new books.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to lobby head teachers and school principals in the area and also use creative and innovative promotional efforts to draw attention to your bookshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branding and careful pricing will also help you in keeping ahead of competition in this business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stocking most recommended text books will also create loyalty among your clients and they will keep coming to you knowing that they will get the books or items they require. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will be your responsibility to attract and retain as many clients as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember you will also be competing with many street vendors who sell text books on the pavements in major towns. These vendors may undercut you since some of them have low overheads, e.g they do not pay rent, electricity etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pros*\n",
    "\n",
    "*No equipment to start\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stocks are clearly defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "*High demand for book exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Does not require a very big space to start\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cons*\n",
    "\n",
    "*May require high capital to stock depending on size\n",
    "\n",
    "*Frequent changes in syllabuses may affect demand\n",
    "\n",
    "A bookshop business can be quite profitable especially on school opening season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some bookshops claim that they make almost 50% more during this time. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can target to make most of your profits for the year on these dates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the street book vendors surveyed claimed to sell about 10 text books and 15 novels each day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Small and medium bookshops sell minimum of 35 books per day on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Margins of 15% and 35% are recorded if you purchase your stock in bulk directly from publishers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, a bookshop business in Kenya is simple to start although may need a higher amount of capital to fully stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you ponder about this idea, don't forget to join our Business Marketing Training to learn brilliant marketing strategies that can make your business more profitable.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It’s one thing to spot an idea, it’s another to have it succeed at the marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tell you the truth, most of the business ideas you will come across out there are only good on paper – only when you implement them will you realize that they actually require a great deal of luck to translate into profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, before you take a plunge and before you even pump your life savings into any business it’s important to do a quick market analysis. Sounds like rocket science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Worry not for I have broken down all the steps you need to take to determine your venture’s chances of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Simplified Market Research for a Small Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Paint a Picture of Your Ideal Customer*\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing who your customers will be, how they behave and what they expect of you is the single biggest favor you can do to your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "By painting a picture of the “ideal customer”, you are better able to identify whatever problems they face and thus the solutions they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can’t easily identify who your potential customers are likely to be then chances are that your idea is faulty and you need to go back to the drawing board.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Snoop On To Their Spending Habits*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are familiar with the traits and behaviors of your customers you should try to figure out their spending patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do they tend to spend more at the beginning of the month? \n",
    "\n",
    "Are they more likely to spend during Christmas? \n",
    "\n",
    "How much are they likely to spend per single visit to the shop? \n",
    "\n",
    "Asking yourself such questions before you set up shop may sound like a stupid idea but it actually helps you set realistic expectations. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also helps you adopt a more suitable business model so that you can streamline your operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Get Them On Your Speed Dial*\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s one thing to figure out who your customer is and how he/she spends their money… it’s another to actually reach them and get them to know that you exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I would like to insist at this point is that, because your business is still small, you will want to use the most affordable yet highly effective marketing option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you go marketing your stuff door to door or do you simply do social media marketing? \n",
    "\n",
    "Do you book a newspaper advert space or do you simply get some billboards in town?\n",
    "\n",
    "Figuring out which method of marketing to use as early as possible is the best way to kick-start a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4: Keep Your Enemies Closer*\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing who your competitors are, and what they offer, can help you make your products and marketing strategies stand out. That can also enable you to set your prices competitively and help you respond to rival strategies with your own initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "This knowledge can also help you to be realistic about how successful you can be. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you notice that a certain market is full of suppliers yet the buying power of consumers doesn’t seem to be growing, it would be safer for you to keep off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, if you notice that despite there being too many competitors most are using inefficient methods to operate, then you can jump in and beat them all by using more efficient methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 5: Sharpen Your Claws*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your competitive edge (or claws in this case) could be the fact that you are able to wake up earlier and deliver your milk to the market before everybody else. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or it could be the fact that you can use a motorbike to beat traffic and deliver orders to your clients on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases your competitive advantage could be the fact that you have got good communication skills that make customers want to come and get their manicure and pedicure done at your salon as you share some stories with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So identify your competitive edge and be ready to do whatever it takes to stand out from the pack. It’s unwise to go for a fight with your claws clipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "So ladies and gentlemen, the next time your friends tell you to invest in quails tell them… “Not so fast, I have to do a market analysis first”… then come back to this article and follow these 5 steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the idea is faulty it won’t get past step 1 because obviously it will not even be possible to paint the image of the “ideal customer”.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, reading through this article is a small price to pay for a life-time of success in the murky waters of entrepreneurship.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are very few markets where demand exceeds supply. One such market is for Kiwi fruits which, despite being a relatively new idea in Kenya, has taken the market by storm. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few farmers who have gotten wind of its valued benefits and you can take advantage of this loophole to make a timely investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a step-by-step guide on how to go about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Kiwi Fruit Farming In Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Acquire or Lease a Piece Of Land*\n",
    "\n",
    "Kiwi vines grow well in areas with adequate rainfall and well drained soil. Think about areas that are neither too wet nor too dry and preferably with red soil which tends to be well drained (unlike black cotton soil).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example Uasin Gishu, Nakuru, Western Kenya, some parts of Kajiado, warmer parts of Central and Nairobi areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start out on a 1/8 th piece of land which can be leased at Ksh.5,000 to Ksh.20,000 per year or bought for Ksh.500,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Preparing the land will cost you an extra Ksh.10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Obtain Seedlings*\n",
    "\n",
    "Seedlings are quite rare to find but with a bit of searching you can always find them. Local nurseries as well as online classified sites like jiji.co.ke are good platforms to start your search.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the option of liaising with seed companies or The Kenya Agricultural Research Institution (KARI) for further assistance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Kiwi Vines that are ready for transplanting are retailing at an average of Ksh.300 per piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1/8 th piece of land will require about 50 vines amounting to Ksh.15,000 in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Plant & Care for the Vines*\n",
    "\n",
    "Plant the vines at around the month of March to take advantage of long-rains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Kiwi Vines are very vulnerable to strong winds and you may need to invest a bit more infrastructure-wise to protect them (e.g. by building a temporary fence or planting some trees around the farm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also you will need to invest in a compost manure and some little amounts of fertilizer (D.A.P and C.A.N) to provide the crop with adequate nutrients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kiwi plants are susceptible to a bacterial infection known as Psa and so you may need to invest in biochemicals that are usually used on fruits like oranges and grapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4: Your First Harvest*\n",
    "\n",
    "The average kiwi vine takes 2 to 3 years to mature and starts producing fruits. The first few harvests may however not be as productive but this tends to improve throughout the plants mature life.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can still commercialize your farm at this time by selling the few fruits that come out of it and healthy vines that you may choose to propagate (Remember, each vine goes for Ksh.300 on average, usually bought by new farmers).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 5: Take It To The Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "The local market is currently under-served as there are very few farmers who have taken up this idea. You can sell to roadside traders or even approach the big supermarkets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is even greater market potential in exporting to neighboring countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much to invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "For 1/8 acre piece of land you will require a minimum of Ksh.50,000 and a maximum of Ksh.100,000 to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cost may however rise if you are leasing or buying the piece of land for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much to expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1/8 acre piece of land with 50 vines can produce 5,000 fruits per year (about 400 Kgs) on a bad season. \n",
    "\n",
    "A bumper harvest can reach up to 10,000 fruits (about 800 Kgs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Kiwi fruit currently retails at an average of Ksh.100. In other words, there’s potential for sales revenues of up to Ksh.1,000,000 per year on such a small piece of land.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, a single vine farm can produce healthy fruits for up to 15 years of maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many benefits of Kiwifruit farming in Kenya, including the fact that this is a relatively passive activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are potential challenges in that the idea is still new in the market and treading through uncharted territory isn’t always that easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see this as a medium to long-term investment opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I conclude this article, I would like to inform you that we have done some changes on our contact numbers and our trainings payment details/numbers.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are fortunate to pass through secondary school’s Commerce class, you might have read it from your Commerce textbooks that “business is buying and selling of goods and services”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people leave school believing that LIE and approach their businesses just with that mentality.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s one of the reasons why most businesses fail!\n",
    "\n",
    "I have heard people saying, “I just need Ksh.XXX. I will go to XYZ and buy ABCD goods and sell”\n",
    "\n",
    "Business is NOT just “buying and selling”. If it were, everybody would have become a millionaire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buying and selling? Who doesn’t know how to do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "You know the problem with buying and selling is that everybody can do it. \n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot make meaningful cash from whatever everyone can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because, well, just any Joe can, and possibly already is selling what you are selling, the same way you are selling it, at the exact same price you are selling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot sell at a good price, you cannot make huge sales, you cannot be rich, if you are merely “buying and selling”.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how good what you are selling is, you will have to use marketing to drive your business, if truly you wish to grow our business and make a lot of money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever seen any small business owner who starts a business (either a kiosk or shop) and just hopes that such business will grow? \n",

    "\n",
    "Have you been in contact with anything made from plastic today? \n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are high that you have just answered yes. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the phone you are using to read this article, computer, buckets, comb, toothbrush, water bottle e.t.c are all made from plastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is so much plastic everywhere and the environment is struggling to deal with loads and loads of the non-biodegradable waste that is produced from our homes and offices daily. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what if I told you that you can start converting this waste into affordable roofing tiles?\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need some plastic and sand to produce high quality roofing material which you can then sell at a good price to those building new homes, schools etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Does this sound like something you would be honoured to do? \n",
    "\n",
    "Read the next few paragraphs to find out more.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How To Start The Business Of Making Roofing Tiles From Used Plastic*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step One: Identify The Need*\n",
    "\n",
    "Affordable roofing has for many years remained a far-fetched dream for many people. \n",
    "\n",
    "Iron sheets and clay tiles are super expensive yet their durability and safety is not always guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, there is too much plastic being released to the environment in form of waste. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, Nairobi alone generates 560 metric tonnes of plastic waste every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "And where does all this waste end up? \n",
    "\n",
    "You guessed it, it ends up in Dandora, Nairobi River or drainage systems clogging up everything and endangering our very own health. \n",
    "\n",
    "So there is a need to first get an affordable roofing solution and secondly a need to get rid of the mountains of trash that are choking our environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Two: Collect Plastics and Sand*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Collect The Plastic*\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is very simple. First you need to collect a decent amount of high density polymer plastic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of high density polymer plastics are: used jerry cans, computer cases, old pipes, water buckets, mobile phone cases and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can hire a few street boys or women to assist you with this. Normally they are paid Ksh.170 per Kilogram brought in.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You Will Need Some Sand*\n",
    "\n",
    "Sand is the second most important ingredient needed here. You can collect this from the river beds or quarries around you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just make sure you find the finest sand with no particles. The smoother and cleaner the sand, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Three: Ooops I Forgot About The Machines*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for you to do this business effectively, you will require two very important machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first machine is the Plastic Shredder. Just as its name suggests a shredder is a machine that chops plastic into small pieces. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second machine you will require is a Plastic Extruder. This is the machine that will mix and melt the plastic and combine it with the sand. \n",
    "\n",
    "These two are nothing fancy really, in fact you can find them locally at Kariobangi Light Industries, Nyarweco Engineering, Makiga Engineering or Polystar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively if you would like to import one from abroad then you can link up with companies like Archana in India or Yaoan Plastic Machinery in China.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Four: Start Making Tiles*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have the machine and raw materials, the process of making tiles will be pretty straight-forward. You simply shred the plastic, then mix with the sand and pour inside the extruder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extruder will do its job and you will collect a molten mixture of sand and plastic on the other end. \n",
    "\n",
    "This you will place in a molder (supplied alongside the machines) which will shape out the roofing tile and within 10 minutes your roofing tiles will be ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to making tiles, you can as well make plastic poles for fencing or manhole covers. \n",
    "\n",
    "These require the same process only that you will replace the sand with saw-dust and adjust the molding process accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Mix 70% plastic with 30% sand for best quality roofing tiles.\n",
    "\n",

    "This is such an interesting idea because you will be in a position to hire many people as the business grows. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you will create employment for that woman in the streets who will be collecting waste plastic for you. You will also create employment for labourers in your plant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further you will create employment for retailers and marketers who will deliver your product to the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that you will also be providing affordable roofing for the Kenyan builders and playing a part in improving our environment at the same time.\n",

    " \n",
    "By the end of 2022, it is estimated that 82% of all internet traffic will move towards video. This indicates that in less than 5 years, marketers are going to broaden their content from text-based to video.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also tells us that this is the perfect time to start a YouTube channel and cash in on it as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "With more than 1.57 billion monthly active users around the world, YouTube is the channel to build your personal brand as an influencer and boost your visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Video blogging is the new popular culture and YouTube has levelled the playing field and given everyone an opportunity to become a celebrity while getting an income from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you are looking to tap into this growing field, here are some few insights to get you off the ground;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Do Your Research*\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do before creating a YouTube channel is conduct some background research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3 basic questions to ask yourself are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why do I want to start a youtube channel?\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is my YouTube channel going to be about?\n",
    "\n",
    "*What are the current YouTubers doing that I can learn from?\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Why*\n",
    "\n",
    "People start YouTube channels for different reasons, the most common being to promote their business, build a personal brand, showcase their talents and share their hobbies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is great to experiment and try out different things but it’s better if you figure out from the beginning what exactly you want your channel to be about.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Topic*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you settle on your topic, ask yourself these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Do I really have passion for this topic?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is there demand out there for this topic?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is Youtube oversaturated with this topic? If yes, how can I stand out then?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some topics that are currently really popular on YouTube are: tutorials, vlogs, tech, product reviews, healthy lifestyle, how to’s, fashion, beauty, food, travel, comedy and life stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What are others doing*\n",
    "\n",
    "Take time to watch other people’s content in your field:\n",
    "\n",
    "*What kind of content do they share?\n",
    "\n",
    "*How do they engage with their audience?\n",
    "\n",
    "*What kind of comments do they receive?\n",
    "\n",
    "*What can you do differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Getting Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed your background research, and settled on what exactly you want to do on YouTube, you will need to have a few things in place before you are ready to click the ‘create a channel’ button, and these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A content plan:* This is a calendar complete with dates, topics, when to do the shoots and anything else that will go into creating your YouTube content.\n",
    "\n",
    "*A catchy and memorable name for your YouTube channel:* Your channel name is crucial since that is your brand. An important tip is to have the same username throughout your other social media channels to brand consistently. You can also use your other social media channels to promote your YouTube content but first study how each works so as to make the best of each channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Search Engine Optimization (SEO):* For people to discover and watch your content, you need to rank highly on YouTube search results. That is where SEO comes in. Ensure you always put up high quality videos that draw people to like, comment and share your videos which in turn boosts your search result rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The right keywords in your title and description box of each video:* Keywords are those words/phrases that searchers enter into a search engine and that is why they must be included in your title and description.\n",
    "\n",
    "*A launch date:* Set aside a day when your content will be going out. This is important because it will help your subscribers know when to expect new content. Start out by posting at least once a week and you can increase the frequency with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*A pipeline of ideas for future videos:* Always carry a notebook and pen to note down random content ideas so that you can build a pipeline of ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Basic Equipment*\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the things you need to be a YouTuber are basic video equipment. YouTubers make it look so easy but creating good quality videos that are visually appealing is harder than it seems.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you do not need to be perfect when it comes to the whole video production process. All you need is the right equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Camera:* Obviously, your most important equipment is a good camera. You do not need the most expensive camera when starting out but any camera that can record high quality videos of at least 1080p. You can get a good quality camera from Ksh.10,000 – Ksh.25,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Smartphone:* A smartphone with high resolution front and back camera is also a necessity. This is because at times you may want to shoot outdoor vlogs where you don’t necessarily need to carry a camera. A good smartphone will set you back Ksh.15,000 – Ksh.20,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Microphone:* It doesn’t matter whether your video is of the best quality, it’s hard to keep your viewers watching with poor audio quality especially since the built-in microphones in cameras and smartphones are not always the best. A lapel mic is the best to start with since it can be easily clipped onto your clothes. You can get a good one for only Ksh.1,800.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tripod:* A tripod basically ensures your video footage is steady. One goes for Ksh.2,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Lighting:* If you plan to shoot most of your videos indoors, lights are important to stabilize the brightness and mood of the video. One approximately costs Ksh.17,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Flash Disk:* As you keep shooting more footage, you will eventually fill up your computer space so having at least a 32GB flash disk can help with the storage. You can get one for Ksh.2,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Laptop:* It is essential to invest in a good laptop where you can edit and post your videos from. You can get a second-hand laptop at Ksh.20,000 but it’s better to invest in a brand new one that might cost anything from Ksh.40,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Video editing software* – After getting all your basic hardware, you also need to invest in a good video editing software for post-production. There are a variety of software’s you can use either as browser or desktop apps both free and paid. Most of them have a 30 day free trial after which you have to pay a fee. As a beginner, we recommend Wondershare Filmora which most youtubers use. You can also check out ShotCut, HitFilm Pro and Cyberlink Powerdirector 18.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Being a YouTuber comes with a lot of benefits:*\n",
    "\n",
    "You have the freedom and flexibility to run your channel as you wish. You don’t need a degree, work experience, office, etc. All you need is your equipment and great content.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can earn money directly from YouTube by enabling your channel for monetization through setting up a google adsense account where you can earn a certain amount every time YouTube runs an ad through your video.\n",
    "\n",
    "With time, you can approach or be approached by brands in your target content area to market their products at a fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need startup capital. Even if you do not have all the equipment from the beginning but start with what you have and you can get better equipment with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube is also the only video platform that makes it so easy to share content on other social media channels, embed videos in websites etc. This makes your video distribution so much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also get to meet and interact with a lot of new people in your comment section only if you actively engage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing your YouTube channel will also boost your confidence, you will gradually learn how to present yourself better, you will learn so much about the topic you are creating content around and all these will contribute to your own personal development.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Challenges*\n",
    "\n",
    "A few challenges you will encounter as a youtuber are;\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are starting from scratch, with no smartphone, no laptop etc, getting all the devices may be more expensive than someone who already has some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube is extremely time consuming. The whole process from planning content, setting up the shoot, shooting the footage, editing, posting, engaging with the comments takes more time than you can imagine. Especially if you have an 8 – 5 job with YouTube as a side thing, you may end up spending most of your free time working on your content\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that for sure you will not avoid as a youtube beginner is negative comments. Even the best of the best in this field get them. You just need to have thick skin, learn from the criticism and encourage yourself with positive self-talk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also be prepared for a lot of competition and at times even copycats. Don’t let this derail you though. Stay true to yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare yourself for a lot of work. As a YouTuber, you take the role of a whole production process. From graphic designer, video editor, social media manager, content creator, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we would like to stress is the numbers will not be encouraging initially. Your first videos will probably get 2 or 3 views but don’t obsess about that. Be consistent and your following will grow with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "Is being a YouTuber something you would consider?\n",
    "\n",
    "I leave it up to you to decide.\n",

    "\n",
    "Timber business in Kenya remains one of the businesses with less competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "With high quality timber, you can make a lot of profits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Timber is usually in high demand and is used to make furniture, construct and roof houses. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a good business location, reliable timber supply and a marketing strategy, you are ready to get started. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is what you need to know to run a successful timber business in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Do a Market Research*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to conduct thorough market research before launching a timber business in Kenya. This research will help you draft a comprehensive business plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will also help you identify quality timber variety that is in demand, whether the business is viable in your locality and also determine the startup capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Write a Timber Yard Business Plan*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a business plan before you can start a timber yard business. It should focus on startup costs, business location, market segmentation, business strengths and risks. \n",
    "\n",
    "A business plan helps a startup to maneuver through the business competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know how to write a business plan, you can hire an expert. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Find a Suitable Timber Business Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of your timber business depends on the location you choose to set up your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your target market will also help you know where to locate your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "If most of your customers are construction sites, then it is convenient to locate the business near the construction site.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if you are into the furniture business, then most of your customers will be residential homes. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it is best to locate the business in a safe location easily accessible to your customers or near a busy road to facilitate easy transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, locating your business in an area with few direct competitors will give you the upper hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Acquire Business Licenses*\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a timber sales business, you need to first register the business. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The demand for metal fabrication products is increasingly on-demand with the increase in construction activities in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a welding business in Kenya is profitable if you get a good business location. You can start a mobile welding business or open a welding stall. \n",
    "\n",
    "A mobile welding business has fewer overheads since you do not need to pay store rent. In this article, we will show you how to start a welding business in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2009, Paul Murage, from Nyeri County, graduated from the National Youth Service Programme with a wide array of knowledge in metal work.\n",
    "\n",
    "He had high hopes of using his newly acquired skill to earn a living and he immediately went into employment in order to gain some much needed experience in this field.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I not only got to sharpen my skill, I also learned where to source for raw materials,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, his employer closed shop and Murage was left to fend for himself. With just Sh.500 in hand, he went on to buy some scrap metal.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I made a jiko and some spoons which I then sold and made a profit. I used that amount to make two more jikos and eventually after selling several jikos, I was able to make my first chaff cutter which I sold at Sh.15,000,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was, however, not easy for him to sell that first cutter as the client was skeptical of his ability to build it.\n",
    "\n",
    "“He made me sign a contract with him at a local police station before he gave me the money to build him the cutter. When it was done, he was very impressed,” Murage says.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proved to be a turning point for him as he realised that he could create a niche for himself in a market dominated by foreign manufacturers.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The chaff cutters that farmers buy from local shops are often imported and are made of cast iron, which is very heavy but also has a tendency to crack,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "To counter this, he used ordinary iron which he turned into stainless steel, which was more durable, lighter and locally available.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Imported chaff cutters cost as much as Sh.45,000 in a shop, but mine sell for as little as Sh.25,000. I also offer a one year service guarantee whereby I fix it in case of any problems,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, his chaff cutters have been sold all over Nyeri County and in other counties across central Kenya, as word spreads about his affordable machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Write a Welding Business Plan*\n",

Getting new appliances is advantageous because when they break down, you can take advantage of the warranty period and get them repaired for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to buy welding machines that are fit for your business. For a medium welding business in Kenya, these are the necessary appliances that you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gas welding machine. You need a gas welding machine if your business involves cutting through heavy metals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Arc welding equipment. It is used for welding metals and repairs. It can be used to weld a wide range of materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mig welding equipment. This is the most commonly used for arc welding processes. You can use the equipment for small and large metal fabrication works. It can be used on materials with varying thicknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tig welding equipment. It is a faster welding equipment used for higher quality welding works. It is excellent since it gives you control over your welding work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get a Welding Business Location*\n",

It will ensure that you are easily accessible and also customers will know the existence of your welding business. Make sure to display your welding work for customers to see. If customers like your work, they will come asking for your services.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get Cheap but Quality Metal*\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers want quality products while on the other hand, as a welder; you need to maximize your profits. As such, you need to get suppliers with lower prices. The metals you will use depend on the profit you are making.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start by making windows, doors, gates, metallic tanks, metallic beds and jikos. Some of the metals that are used in welding include steel, copper and aluminium. Get a reputable company to supply you with the metals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get Skilled Staff*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need highly skilled staff for your welding business. You can opt to work as a welding technician, or you can hire a skilled person. Getting a person with the right skills will make customers like your work and refer more customers to your business. Most vocational training centers in Kenya train on welding.

    "\n",
    "Real estate is a good investment in Kenya because the returns are very high. There is a high demand for land and homes. The supply is deficient, and the demand for property is skyrocketing in Kenya.\n",
    " \n",
    "The value of the property appreciates in a relatively short period.\n",

    " \n",
    "Some buyers could buy to build homes or rental properties. Others might buyer to hold and sell at a higher price in the future.\n",
    " \n",
    "After you sub-divided the land you will have to sell the smaller portions of land. These smaller portions are known as plots.\n",
    " \n",
    "If one acre of land cost you 2 million, you could end-up making 6 million in gross sales. All you need is to sub-divide the land into one eighth (1/8) pieces (or plots of size 50 x 100 square feet.)\n",
    " \n",
    "Sell a single plot at Ksh.750,000. After expenses, you should make at least 3 million in net profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investing in land may seem to be easy. People make money every day from buying and selling land.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who are successful in this business have done well their homework and have perhaps learnt some important investment lessons the hard way. \n",
    " \n",
    "Investing in land like any other business involves risk taking. As an investor, you should be putting your money into an asset while ready to face any challenge as well as setbacks that may come along. \n",
    " \n",
    "There are several pros and cons to investing in land. \n",
    "\n",
    "One ought to be very careful before investing in any land because many have burnt their figures while bidding for the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those who want to take the plunge, there are few things you need to consider.\n",
    " \n",
    "Before you settle on a particular choice of land you should conduct a thorough market research. You need to find out why the land you want to purchase is vacant. You can buy land only to discover later it cannot be effectively used, let alone developed. \n",
    " \n",
    "It is worth purchasing land whose zoning permits its highest, and best use. \n",
    " \n",
    "A friend of mine bought some land, 1/8th acre, for 1 million in 2014 in some remote undeveloped area. He decided to sell the land in mid 2016 and the only serious prospective buyers were two, who offered 800,000 and 900,000 shillings after more than 2 years. \n",
    " \n",
    "So if you buy land that you can't use instantly due to its remoteness, you will be tying up capital and hoping that after five years of doing nothing, you find someone to buy the land at a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of utilities like water electricity, good sewerage system, and good communication network is a huge setback for any land investor especially if you want to set up real estates or even for personal settlement.\n",
    " \n",
    "Market demand is also another factor to consider. Areas where people would want to rent or build housing units is a nice opportunity. Lands in upcoming settlement towns like Machakos, Kisii, Kitale, Kakamega are good. \n",
    " \n",
    "In fact, if you have a million shillings, you are likely to get prime land in your home county HQ compared to what you would get in Nairobi. \n",
    "\n",
    "These towns provide a quiet area for privacy away from crowded cities. These towns have room for future expansion and thus probabilities for high returns.\n",
    " \n",
    "Another thing to watch for is the risk of acquisition and encroachment. Purchasing land in which government utility belongs e.g. road or a park will cause your investments to sink. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some scenarios, your legal right over the land gets jeopardised, resulting in litigation and unnecessary legal costs. \n",
    " \n",
    "These auxiliary expenses can sometimes outweigh the appreciation in the value of your land. \n",
    "\n",
    "There’s also the risk of the land being taken over by the government by way of compulsory acquisition like a case where the government want to set up infrastructure. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good case is the Standard Gauge Railway. The compensation received, may not always be satisfactory.\n",
    " \n",
    "In as much as you would have found the right place to pump your cash, you should be on the outlook for fraudsters. With preying cons around prowling for gullible buyers, buying land is tricky. \n",
    " \n",
    "Unscrupulous land brokers are out there waiting for your cash. Some fraudsters work with the ministry of lands officials to issue you fake title deeds. They will do anything to hit you especially if you are a jackpot investor. \n",
    " \n",
    "Employ the services of a lawyer and engage the Land commission who will help you verify the authenticity of the land you want to purchase. If the ministry gives you fake information concerning the land then you are entitled to compensation from the state for losses incurred.\n",
    " \n",
    " Before investing in land remember, land business, like any other business, has good and bad deals... not all land deals are good even if you don't get conned.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Money Bag’s play is to ‘outspend’ the competition. Even when outsmarting them could be more effective and less expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with spending so much early on in the business is you could run out of fuel just at the point when the business really needs the money. \n",

    "\n",
    "What Juma doesn’t know is that his small business has other more important priorities to deal with. \n",

    "While such image building tactics may help, they may not have a significant effect to the company’s bottomline.\n",

    "24/04/2022, 10:32 am - +254 754 839228: *UNDERSTANDING HOW COSMETICS BUSINESS WORKS*\n",
    " \n",
    "Demand for beauty and cosmetic products in Kenya has grown steadily over the last one decade. Within those few years, some of the small retailers in this line of business have grown into “supermarket” status and they have opened branches across the region. \n",
    " \n",
    "Clearly, you don’t need rocket science to understand just how promising this industry is. \n",
    " \n",
    "Remember the rule is: start small, grow with it. Start your small cosmetics shop using the least possible capital. \n",
    " \n",
    "To succeed in any business, you need to know how it works and how you can win the competition. You can start by researching online and talking to people buying beauty products. Understand what potential customers want and the figure out how best you can deliver. \n",
    " \n",
    "Also, talk to those in the business, find out what they are selling and at what price. Also, understand the market gap. Then find ways you can address the problems in the cosmetics industry.\n",
    " \n",
    "You can succeed in the cosmetics business if you know the tricks and risks involved. It becomes easy to navigate your way and grow your business.\n",
    " \n",
    "The first step to starting any business is to understand how it works. Fortunately, there are a few ways to do that.\n",
    " \n",
    "You can start by studying everything you can online. Look up for cosmetics sellers and dealers online, and learn everything you can about them.\n",
    " \n",
    "Where are they from? Where do their products come from? How many employees do they have? What does their distribution channel look like?\n",
    " \n",
    "Next, look for the most popular beauty stores in your area and study them, too. Get familiar with their marketing, their staffing, their product selection… basically, your goal is to learn literally everything you can about the most successful cosmetics businesses in your area!\n",
    " \n",
    "Then – and here’s the fun part – go buy some products from them! Experiment. Play. Have fun and see what kind of magic you can pull off by giving your friends makeovers.\n",
    " \n",
    "But the absolute best way to learn about the industry is to work in it.\n",
    " \n",
    "Remember those stores you were studying? Go get a job at one of them! Learn their sales tactics, how they target customers, how they establish their sales projections, how they handle their ordering.\n",
    " \n",
    "Know who their suppliers are, and what kind of prices they pay.\n",
    " \n",
    "And learn as much as you can!\n",
    " \n",
    "If you want to start a cosmetics business from home, then start researching which company you want to work under e.g Forever Living\n",
    " \n",
    "This is a GREAT option for those with limited budgets but huge social networks and people skills!\n",
    " \n",
    "Once you have decided on which model you are interested in pursuing, whether you want to open a brick and mortar cosmetics store, start a home based cosmetics business, or even create one online, then it’s time to create a plan.\n",
    " \n",
    "*What Legal Fees Are Required To Set Up A Cosmetic Business?*\n",
    " \n",
    "Running a cosmetic business does not require special licenses. \n",
    " \n",
    "The only mandatory license is a single business permit. The license can be obtained from the relevant county government offices. \n",
    " \n",
    "The fee charged depends on the size of the business, the county government at stake and location within the county. Generally, the annual fee ranges from Ksh.3,000 to Ksh.15,000.\n",
    " \n",
    "Otherwise you can start an online shop and be selling your cosmetics items on Facebook or an ecommerce website to avoid these overheads.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Select a Suitable Location*\n",
    " \n",
    "Location determines the success of any business. It is best to get a stall where you can display beauty products and has a high influx of people. \n",
    " \n",
    "Get a storefront where there is high foot traffic. You can also start your business inside a mall, plaza, or in a kiosk. Look what works best for you and ensure that your option is within your budget.\n",
    " \n",
    "Essentially, look for a visible place from the street, has a parking area, easy to access, and has high foot traffic.\n",
    " \n",
    "Also you can start this business as a freelancer until you build a reliable client base. Later on, you can look for a stall in town (by town I mean any town not just Nairobi) – a permanent location or office is quite good because it boosts your credibility to customers and even financiers. \n",
    " \n",
    "A good 10ft by 5ft stall in a busy street goes for Ksh.20,000 in Nairobi. Some landlords ask for a goodwill payment but some don’t.\n",
    " \n",
    "*What Are Some of the Fastest Moving Goods?*\n",
    " \n",
    "Generally, the fastest moving goods out of a cosmetics shop are the items people use on a day-to-day basis. \n",

    "To get your invested capital back in a short time, here’s what to sell in your cosmetics store. They move like wild-fire.\n",

    "\n",
    "The more I travel and visit farms in different parts of our beautiful country, the more I fall in love with pawpaw farming in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "I specifically love the small red-flesh Solo Sunrise variety growing in the hot areas of ukambani and parts of Embu and Meru. \n",
    "\n",
    "I recently tasted some fruits from Vihiga in Western Kenya and I was thrilled! The climate and soils there are also perfect for a pawpaw farming business and the locals are taking up the opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now talking about a business of growing pawpaw makes the deal even sweeter. Despite all the health benefits and the sweetness that these fruits offer, they are some of the easiest crops to cultivate commercially.\n",
    "\n",
    "I visited a pawpaw farm in Marigat, Baringo County. Yes, that’s right; Baringo County. This place is one of the most hostile parts of Kenya in terms of climate. It was my first time to experience real heat waves with temperatures rising to about 40°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would expect nothing meaningful to come from such a place. I was surprised to find a thriving pawpaw plantation right at the heart of this place. The 2-acre Solo Sunrise pawpaw farm had all the trees still fruiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Production has really gone down since we last had rains in October last year. We are currently getting just about 250kg from each acre in a week.” Said Robert. I later learned that he was selling a kg of the fruits at Ksh.80 due to the low supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "I noted that the trees are not irrigated, and they had not been weeded for the longest time except for the slashing of the grasses. I wondered how they survived the dry spell and still produced that much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on we also visited Matuu. It is here that I found another pawpaw farm right at the middle of an arid area but still producing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Philip, the manager of the farm told us that they were not tending to the pawpaw trees at all since they were old and the owner of the farm was planning to develop a 2-acre commercial farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "“So you are not harvesting any fruits from these old trees?” I asked Philip.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We are harvesting. Every tree gives us about 2 fruits every two weeks. We supply a small market comprised of friends of my boss.” He told me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then I have visited several other successful pawpaw farms in Kenya especially in Meru and Baringo. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few farmers have the crop at a commercial scale but the much they do is to weed twice a year and water about once a week. Those who do this can tell you that an acre of solo sunrise pawpaw can yield up to 40 tons in a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "An acre of solo sunrise pawpaw can produce 40 tons per year\n",
    "\n",
    "Pawpaw farming is best done in places with warm or hot climate. In such places, farmers who have access to irrigation water make a kill since the price of pawpaw in Kenya is never less than Ksh.30 per kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pawpaws grow very fast and in the hot areas, you get your first fruits in 6 months from planting the seed. This is the case I found in Marigat, Baringo County and Matiliku in Makueni County.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these dry places, the pawpaws are also not frequently attacked by pests and diseases. In fact, several of the farmers I visited were growing pawpaws purely organically, even using animal manure as the only fertilizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maintenance cost of a pawpaw orchard can be as low as Ksh.10,000 for an acre in a year since only labor during weeding and application of the manure is needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This one acre then produces about 20 tons of fruits in a year – that is without irrigation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the current market price of a kg of pawpaw in your local supermarkets or open air market and just find out how much you are able to make from one acre of pawpaw with this minimum input.\n",

    "So how much do you invest and what are the expected returns?  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Returns:*\n",
    "\n",
    "The average yield per acre of various varieties of pawpaw is about 40 tons per year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Farm gate prices for a kilo of pawpaw go as high as Ksh.60 but let us take a more conservative price of Ksh.30 per kg and a yield of 30 tons per acre. \n",
    "\n",
    "The total income for the first year then comes to Ksh.900,000 giving a profit of Ksh.726,500. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same crop should also produce about the same tonnage in the second year. After the second year, production starts going down but with proper farm management, the same trees could give you good quantities in the third and fourth year. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the lifespan of the trees depend mainly on the variety. \n",
    "\n",
    "The varieties commonly cultivated in Kenya are solo sunrise and mountain pawpaw and have a lifespan of up to 4 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "New dwarf varieties such as calina papaya IPB9, the Malaysian Red Lady and the Red Royal have gained much popularity in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new dwarf varieties have numerous advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The trees are easy to manage due to their size\n",
    "    \n",
    "*They produce big fruits of about 1kg each but still with a good keeping quality\n",
    "    \n",
    "*They are self-pollinating hence no male trees that only take up space without producing fruits.\n",

    "\n",
    "IBM. Coca-Cola. Ford. Nestlé. Pepsi. General Electric. Procter & Gamble. Bacardi.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m sure these names ring a bell. Apart from being large, highly successful global businesses, they also have something very interesting in common:\n",
    "\n",
    "All of them have been in existence for more than a century. Yes, started over 100 years ago, the entrepreneurs who started them are long dead, but these businesses have continued to exist, thrive and expand even after the minds that conceived them left this earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these businesses, like Ford and Bacardi, have remained within family circles, and passed through successive generations. Other businesses — like Coca-Cola, IBM, and General Electric — have changed hands several times but continue to exist and expand as very successful companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do family-controlled businesses have a better chance of ‘multi-generational survival’ than non-family-controlled businesses? \n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, there’s some interesting evidence in favour of family-controlled businesses. However, to my mind, both types of businesses have a good chance of survival if some things are done right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across Africa, I have noticed the situation is quite different. Apart from a handful of small family businesses, and a few others with colonial ties, it’s often not the norm to find African businesses or brands that have survived beyond their founders.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some strange reason, after the founder retires or dies, the business starts on a path of slow or accelerated death.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I share my thoughts on this ugly trend, and 5 of the biggest reasons why most African businesses don’t last beyond a generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1) Poor Succession Planning*\n",
    "\n",
    "Africans typically don’t like to think or talk about death, grave misfortune or permanent disability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody would wish for any of any of these, but they are some of life’s risks and realities. And we must always consider, and plan for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while human life is finite and vulnerable to death and misfortune, a business can ‘theoretically’ live forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best time to find a successor with the right level of commitment, vision and zeal to lead a business beyond the lifetime of the founder isn’t when the founder retires or is on his/her deathbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the right successor to take the reins of a business is a conscious, deliberate and calculated process (or decision) that should not be left to chance, or emergency situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, the earlier the process of succession planning is started in the life of a business, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Death, misfortune, and accidents never give advance warnings. There’s an intrinsic risk in every young business that it could cease to exist if the brain behind it suddenly disappears (probably due to death or illness) or is no longer available for some reason to nurture, drive and grow the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, planning for succession doesn’t have to be tough and complicated, like most entrepreneurs think. The secret is to make the conscious decision, and start the process early.\n",
    "\n",
    "Successors could come from anywhere. They could come from within the family (children, siblings etc.), or they could be business partners who share the risk and ownership of the business with you. Successors could also be your most promising employee(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have identified the likely candidate(s), it’s important to get them more involved in the business and groom them for leadership. \n",
    "\n",
    "They need to understand the nuts and bolts of the business and share a strong interest and passion in growing it into a bigger and better organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you identify any skills or knowledge they may be missing, invest in their learning and training. Formal education, short courses, mentorship, coaching and exposure are critical to the nurture and grooming of successors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever I discuss succession with entrepreneurs, the most common kickback I get is: “what if these potential successors know too much and become dangerous to the business?”\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s a valid concern, but to my mind, the risk of the business going extinct due to poor succession planning is far more dangerous than this concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2) Small thinking*\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s no crime in starting small. Most businesses start small. Often, the mistake is staying small and ignoring possibilities for growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many African businesses remain small all through the lifetime of the founder. And I think one key reason for this is most founders think small. \n",
    "\n",
    "What stops that small corner shop from becoming a national or international franchise? \n",
    "\n",
    "Why can’t that popular neighborhood product or service that you provide become a global brand?\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know that Coca-Cola was initially developed as a patient medicine; an elixir that claimed to cure morphine addiction and headaches? \n",
    "\n",
    "This dark-colored drink, developed by a local drugstore owner in 1885, has now become a hugely successful international brand – a casual drink that exemplifies fun, friendship and refreshment!\n",
    "\n",
    "To my mind, small thinking undermines the possibilities and potential of many businesses in Africa. If only we knew how truly big some of our local products and services could truly become, most African founders would test the limits of their vision and challenge themselves more.\n",
    "\n",
    "By thinking big, the possible lifespan of your business automatically increases. Growth and expansion is an objective that could take several generations to accomplish, and embracing this fact can eliminate shortsightedness and increase your horizon of possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best part: thinking small – like thinking big – costs nothing. It’s absolutely free!\n",
    "\n",
    "*3) Lack of structure and business systems*\n",
    "\n",
    "One key trait of successful businesses, especially those that have existed through several generations, is the existence of a clear structure and business systems that help the business to operate effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure is essential to every well-run business because it provides order, assigns responsibilities for key activities and improves accountability. Many African businesses cannot function independently of the founder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if they are out of town for any reason, or unavailable to sign cheques, suppliers and employees may not get paid on time. \n",
    "\n",
    "If he/she doesn’t OK a deal, it’s likely to fall through. \n",
    "\n",
    "His/her involvement in the business is often so central and too personal that it gets in the way of everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business systems are also very important. How many medium-sized businesses on the continent actually have policies and procedures that govern everything from recruitment, employee conduct, finance and accounting, among others?\n",
    "\n",
    "How many businesses actually keep accurate and up-to-date records of their activities, including complete information about operations, finances, transactions, customers, suppliers, employees and everything else?\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not surprising then that the most critical information and records concerning most businesses are housed in the heads of their founders. They seem to be the only ones who know where everything should be and how the business should run.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this kind of ‘chaos’, it’s almost impossible to carry on a business when the almighty founder is unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4) Blind to business trends and changes*\n",
    "\n",
    "Another strong feature of businesses that last beyond a generation is their ability to adapt. In a world of constantly changing markets, consumer trends, socio-political influences and outright disruption, adaptation is a key strength of businesses that will survive today and in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapt or die!\n",
    "\n",
    "Many businesses seem to think that they have found a formula for success that will remain effective for a thousand years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurs are often too focused on running their businesses that they don’t take the time to look into the distance to think, strategize or identify current and future threats or risks that could significantly affect their business, or worse still, kick them out of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s globalized and interconnected world, one disruptive idea or business in a faraway country can totally change the landscape of your industry or market so fast you may never find the time to think or plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking into the future, changes and trends in both the local and international market place will be one of the biggest risks that African entrepreneurs and businesses are likely to face. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a growing number of foreign businesses and brands increasing their footprint in Africa, even small family-owned corner shops and neighborhood businesses may not be spared.\n",
    "\n",
    "To survive in these times of rapid change, entrepreneurs need to be open-minded and must not take everything for granted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a few decades ago, no business is too big to fail these days. One little unknown startup could have your business for lunch if you are not prepared to adapt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among several others, Über is one example of a foreign disruptive idea/business that is changing the landscape of business across Africa – urban transport, in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "My advice: stay in the know about developments in your market and industry, both locally and globally. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seek out innovative ways and technologies to make your business run more efficiently; make your products and services more valuable; keep your employees committed and effective; and improve the satisfaction of your customers.\n",

    "*5) A dominant ‘lifestyle’ mentality*\n",
    "\n",
    "I watched an interesting TEDx Talk by Visu Thembekwayo about some of the reasons why African businesses remain small.\n",
    "\n",
    "He makes a strong point about the business philosophy of the average African entrepreneur. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the world, the success of a business is often seen by many entrepreneurs as a mandate to shore up their lifestyle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fancy cars and homes, globetrotting, expensive clothing, extravagant spending, and lavish displays of wealth are often common. \n",
    "\n",
    "I guess prudence and moderation are hardly metrics to live by, especially when it comes to showcasing your success to friends, family and associates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, a dominant lifestyle mentality does two dangerous things to the longevity of a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is distraction. The funds you are using to shore up your lifestyle can actually be dedicated to improving and expanding the business into a much bigger success. \n",
    "\n",
    "Those funds could also be used for strategic investments that diversify or consolidate the business, making it stronger and more resilient. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, using proceeds from the business to celebrate your ‘success’ is really a sign of small thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is you are sending the wrong signals to your employees and potential successors. People are watching. If you treat the business like an ATM, it’s going to be really hard for anybody else to manage the business with diligence and prudence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we see a business as an asset that should be nurtured and expanded beyond our lifetime, maybe we wouldn’t do our best to suck the life out of it, or just see it as a tool to serve our lifestyle interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Putting everything together…*\n",
    "\n",
    "Africa can have its own IBMs, Coca-Colas, Fords and Nestlés. But it will not happen by chance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurs on the continent need to take quick, deliberate and calculated steps to navigate the roadblocks and risks I have shared with you in this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our continent has several unique products that have the potential to become global brands and build international corporations. \n",
    "\n",
    "While they could become global brands all the same with or without African entrepreneurs, it would be great if we can pull this off ourselves.\n",

    "When I meet Julius Mulei, at his shop in Nairobi Central Business District, he was busy packaging fruits to take to his customers.\n",

    "\n",
    "The rise of entrepreneurs who have made money through government tenders has brought unusual attention to the twists and turns of the tendering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is true that a single tender is capable of changing your life forever, it is also true that the tendering process is a tedious and tricky one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many people give up at the preliminary stages and the few that soldier on have horror stories to tell of long delays, bribery and the general hassle that goes into securing a tender.\n",
    "\n",
    "In February 2012, President Mwai Kibaki directed that 10 per cent of all government contracts be earmarked and awarded to the youth. \n",
    "\n",
    "The directive was informed by the government’s realization that to meaningfully address the issue of youth unemployment, it was necessary to give young people opportunities to benefit from these contracts and tenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2013, the procurement rules were further amended to allow 30 per cent of all government contracts to be given to the youth, women and the disabled. \n",
    "\n",
    "Big businesses now have to share procurement opportunities with smaller companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The road to securing a tender may be a long and narrow one, paved with many challenges, but the influx of a new crop of rich individuals who have made a fortune from tenders has made the trade attractive to young people, whose dream is to clinch that one contract that they hope will make all their dreams come true.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how easy is it to secure a tender? Is the tendering process as open and transparent as the government claims it to be?\n",
    "\n",
    "While you might want to argue that getting a tender when you are a “small person” with no connections is similar to going out on a futile fishing mission on the banks of polluted Nairobi River; there are indeed opportunities available for those who are patient enough and willing to learn from experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of limiting your growth potential to the purchasing power of your retail customers, you can regularly try your luck by applying for tenders. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you run a small bookshop in say Bomet; why not visit local schools and drop your tender documents when opportunities arise?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tenderpreneurship is one of the fastest ways to make money in Kenya – and if growth is what you are looking for, then this is an area worth exploring.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You have a friend, called Otieno who needs a loan for his butchery. You don’t have time yourself to run that kind business but you believe there is opportunity in the meat industry and figured you might as well benefit in some way from the returns of this business. \n",
    "\n",
    "So you lend Otieno Ksh.100,000 payable in three years which he will use to refurbish his butchery. \n",
    "\n",
    "However you can’t lend Otieno Ksh.100,000, wait three years and only get back Ksh.100,000. That would be unfair to you because you could have done something else with the money i.e. there is an opportunity cost to lending Otieno the money. \n",
    "\n",
    "So Otieno agrees to pay you interest of 10% per annum to compensate you for this opportunity cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the nature of how money goes in and out of his business he can’t pay you every month. At the same time it is not fair on you to have to wait till the end of the year or end of three years to get your return. \n",
    "\n",
    "Otieno therefore agrees to pay you interest every six months or semi- annually. In a year you would be earning Ksh.10,000 (10% of Ksh.100,000). \n",
    "\n",
    "If he is paying interest every six months that will translate to you earning Ksh.5,000 every half year for three years. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last payment at the end of three years will be the final interest of Ksh.5,000 plus you will get back the initial capital invested of Ksh.100,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Treasury Bonds is an area that a lot of people would like to invest in but think it is very complicated. I agree the way information is displayed about Bonds, is not very user friendly. \n",
    "\n",
    "However our scenario above with Otieno is exactly how most bonds work only that Otieno is the government. \n",
    "\n",
    "The government borrows from us to finance certain expenditures like infrastructure, development etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The loan that we give the government is referred to as a Bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the intended use of the funds, bonds can be issued from 1 year to 30 years. This is known as the tenor of the bond. The interest rate a bond will earn is referred to as the coupon. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you invested in a three year bond with a coupon rate of 10%, the payments to you will be paid semi – annually in the exact same way as when you invested in Otieno’s business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now Otieno can decide to raise Ksh.1,000,000 for his business from various investors. Some will give 100,000; others 50,000; and others 200,000 depending on their ability at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "All Otieno is interested in is getting to a total amount of Ksh.1 million. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you put in Ksh.50,000 or Ksh.200,000 you will all earn an interest rate of 10% p.a. on your money. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way the government can opt to raise even Ksh.15 billion from various investors but the minimum they will take from any one investor is actually Ksh.50,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "So as long as you have Ksh.50,000 you can invest in a bond. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bonds, contrary to popular belief are not only for the wealthy or for institutions. If you put in Ksh.50,000 and someone else Ksh.50 million you will earn pretty much the same coupon (or interest rate) on your money. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many people look at the Ksh.15 billion the government is trying to raise and instantly think their money is too little.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have idle money or looking for a secure place to invest, this is definitely worth considering. Your Ksh.50,000 sitting in a savings account would probably not earn the same rate of return as bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonds are also a good way of securing a source of income and can come in handy when planning for Retirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many people who want to keep a portion of their retirement portfolio safe while earning an income to help meet with everyday expenses have opted to invest in Bonds. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you had built up a retirement portfolio of Ksh.10 million, this same bond would earn you Ksh.1.28 million per year which translates to Ksh.100,000 per month. That could be a large portion of what you actually need to live off. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Ksh.10,000,000 will remain intact while you just live off the income being generated.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Especially in the beginning, entrepreneurship can be a tough and lonely journey. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a business is still young, it’s common for the founder to be the CEO, Accountant, HR Specialist, Head of Operations and more, rolled into one. \n",
    "\n",
    "This situation forces entrepreneurs to be very resourceful and become a ‘Jack of All Trades.’\n",
    "\n",
    "While this can be a good thing, it can have an equally dangerous side effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Lone Wolf is an entrepreneur who still carries an unhealthy burden of the business on his shoulders. As a result, she could feel stressed and overworked, and the business may not grow or perform better. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Lone Wolf is usually a very ‘hands-on’ entrepreneur who would rather do things herself than ask for help, collaborate or delegate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, the Lone Wolf may not have actually started a business because she is unwilling to share ideas, partner and collaborate with others, her idea may never become a real-life business.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Lone Wolf has a ‘I can do it all attitude’\n",
    "\n",
    "A new business idea is like a baby, you want to cuddle it, stroke it and protect it from anyone who shows up to critic your idea, give you a list of reasons why your idea won’t work or even explain vividly how it will be impossible for you to implement the idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "These often makes new entrepreneurs shy away from sharing their ideas and involving other people in the potential business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feeling of, “Since I came up with the idea, I am best placed to implement it and have it come out exactly how I want it,” takes over more often due to pride or fear that bringing in and listening to others will corrupt your original idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, instead of helping, this might slow down your implementation or result in you getting stuck along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "As much as it is not advisable to listen to everyone’s opinion about your business, it is important to seek a mentor preferably one who is successful in the same business you want to venture into. \n",
    "\n",
    "The unwillingness to collaborate, partner and team up with other ‘like-minded’ people is one of the biggest obstacles that face young and aspiring entrepreneurs in Africa. \n",
    "\n",
    "By teaming up with other people, we could share the risks and responsibilities of starting a business. The stress is likely to become more bearable, and the team spirit will make the journey less lonely and more fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t forget, nobody has all the answers. But by connecting, networking, collaborating and partnering with others, you could gradually find your way to the answers you seek.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bible has said it thousands of years ago; two are better than one.\n",

    "\n",
    "When we were young, our teachers and relatives would often ask us “What would you like to become when you grow up?” \n",
    "\n",
    "And we would answer heartily: “A pilot” “A teacher” “The President” “A rocket scientist” or something similar to that.\n",
    "\n",
    "But times have really changed, and those so-called “big professions” are no longer the in thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Larry Keya is a young man who seems to have figured out this already.\n",
    "\n",
    "He decided to become a farmer and an online tutor right after graduating from campus. We recently caught up with Mr. Larry in his farm in Eldoret and managed to grab a few jewels of wisdom from him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though promising, farming is a journey full of roses and thorns. When you start the walk, you have high hopes and expectations but along the way you realize without creativity and grit, nothing good may come out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like for most farmers, that is the story of Larry Keya a graduate of Agriculture Economics from Moi University who ventured into cucumber farming with gusto but got a baptism by fire before he broke even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things seemed to be working well for Keya when he made a first attempt at cucumber farming in 2012 at his farm in Kapseret, Uasin Gishu County.\n",
    "\n",
    "He did his homework well and bought the seeds, prepared the land and planted the crops. Being a fast maturing crop, they were ready for harvest in less than three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Lucky for me, the crops did well and were not attacked by any pests. I think what also helped was the fact that I grew them in a greenhouse. I harvested 500kgs of cucumber that I assumed would fetch good money,” Keya said.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the joy of a bumper harvest was short-lived because he encountered a major setback at the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The traders at Eldoret Main Market said the cucumbers were fine but were coiled thus not ideal for selling. I was really disappointed.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I had to go back with them after several attempts to sell them failed. Because of the high perishability, within a few weeks, they were all rotten,” Keya said.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was a big loss for him given that he had secured a Sh.150,000 loan from the government’s Youth Fund Enterprise programme to finance the project and was worried he would lose the collateral.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such a depressing scenario, he had to think fast. After making some inquiries and researching online, an idea came to him on value addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "“After extensive research I discovered that cucumber could be used to make juice just like watermelon. I bought a blender for the job,” he explains.\n",
    "\n",
    "He began blending cucumbers and watermelons for juice but at first, they were not well received in the market. Keya had to think outside the box. And that is how the idea to make popsicles, popularly known as ice pops, came to mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new products were accepted well in the local market within a short time. What boosted his sales was the fact that he launched the business during a hot season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slowly, with his savings from his ice pops business, Keya bought an efficient ice pop making machine at Sh.120,000 to boost his output to match the growing demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The machine was a game changer because it made work easier. I used to extract juice from the cucumbers and watermelon, make a syrup, put some additives and freeze them on sticks,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the machine, he would make at least 700 pieces of ice pops a day which he sold to vendors at Sh.5 each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selling at least 500 pieces a day, Keya would make Sh.2,500 with a profit margin of 60 per cent from total sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the business grew, he taught his wife how to make them so that he could get time to tend to greenhouses and ensure sustained production of cucumber and melons, the raw materials for the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "With time, he says demand for the popsicles increased prompting him to buy a bigger machine at a cost of Sh.380,000. This one makes 7,800 pieces of ice pops in under 24 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The machine added more value as it would mold the ice pops in fancy shapes that consumers loved. My sales increased and I could also make bigger ice pops that we sold at Sh.7 per piece. With an average sale of 900 pieces daily, my income was Sh.6,300 per day,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "With over 20 vendors and the rising demand, Keya started making yoghurt on a stick, using the same procedure for cucumber and watermelon ice pops. He sells these at Sh.20 per piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "He got certification and approval from Kenya Bureau of Standards and his Sweet De Laat Food and Drink Company distributes cucumber, mango and milk-based popsicles in Uasin Gishu, Kakamega, Trans Nzoia, Nandi and Turkana counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Opportunities are always available. You just have to be open-minded enough to look and see them. Farming in itself presents one of the best opportunity to create income because everyone everyday must eat. The Key is starting small with patience and persistence” says Larry Keya\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope Larry Keya`s success story has been an inspiration and enlightenment to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Farming can be a profitable business, if you understand it to be a “business”. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem we have about encouraging Kenyans to embrace farming is that, most people see agriculture as a dirty thing. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Over the years I have studied the life of many great achievers in the world. I have read many biographies of successful business men, politicians and spiritual leaders.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have learned so many things about factors that made these people successful while their mates are failures. Some of those factors vary from one person to another but one remains constant… they are all educated men and women.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I mention education, so many people will think that I am talking about school. You are wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "I remember reading the autobiography of Bill Clinton (former US president). One major thing that inspired me about his life was how he read 300 (non-academic) books in two years when he was a young man. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clinton continued in this crazy act of reading and that was a major reason why he achieved greatness in his political career.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decided to sleep in the same room with Abraham Lincoln, you have got a problem because Lincoln would wake up at night and start reading aloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jimon Ibrahim is a Nigerian millionaire who gave his wife a funny rule, “Don't knock whenever I enter my library”.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Bill Gates built his mighty mansion some years ago, his library stands at the top of the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obafemi Awolowo was one of the most influential Nigerian politicians. I was privileged to read a newspaper written in the year 1987 when he died. Awolowo was a lover of books, till he died (in fact, he still bought a book about three days before he died)\n",
    "\n",
    "Awolowo was of the opinion that anybody who intends to be great in life must be reading great books (not academic books) at least, 4 hours a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know your day may be too busy to allow that, but you can create time within your week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading is not limited to books only, it can be reading great and educative articles such as the ones we are posting in our PROFITABLE BUSINESS IDEAS WhatsApp group.\n",
    "\n",
    "No one has ever succeeded in life, either in business, politics or spiritual ministry, without being a great reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask me, but why? \n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you. Let me explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either in politics, business or in any other career, what makes you stand at the top of others is exceptional knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the time you know far more than people around you, they have no choice than to bow for you. They will beg you with leadership. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think I have a practical experience of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the grace of God while I was at The University of Nairobi, school of business, Lower Kabete campus, my usual annual goal was to read 30 to 50 self-development books each year. These books equipped me with a lot of knowledge that my mates could never have.\n",
    "\n",
    "I remember reading “How to make friends and influence people” and made more friends than most people in my class. \n",
    "\n",
    "I remember reading 'Art of public speaking' and whenever I stood before my class to speak, everyone would listen.\n",
    "\n",
    "I remember reading so many other books and the result would be that whenever I encountered my friends or political competitors, I would beat them, hands down.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a point, one of the most prestigious clubs in my campus wanted me to be their leader while many people were contesting for that office. My mates were struggling to be chosen, but the stakeholders of that club wanted me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? \n",
    "\n",
    "Because, by God's grace I had mental strengths to lead that club to great success. By the time I was about to graduate, I had read many good books about business and financial success that I wondered why on earth would I be poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mathematics is very simple if you understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a politician you are actually contesting with knowledge. The more you know, the better you can sell your manifesto to the electorates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes when I walk around with friends or see some political posters, I would comment on the pictures or the words used in the bill. I would suggest how they would have been done better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Political tactics are more or less marketing strategies. It doesn't matter what your products are, a poor marketing will kill your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge is the source of strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to the point I am making. There is a great conspiracy about the real source of knowledge. While we can all agree that education is the secret behind all success, what most people call education is school.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take my word as true because I’m telling you what I know with certainty. Nobody has ever become a great success in life simply by having a certificate or by attending the best school.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people you see today and can call successful are men and women who rule the world with great knowledge they have acquired in the libraries when their mates were sleeping or watching football matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "But they won`t tell you. Nobody has time to tell you their secret, except some of us who are angry about the high rate of unemployment in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthony Robbins in his book, Unlimited Power said, no wonder there are more failures in the world than successes, since most people don`t read meaningful books and most people who even pick books to read only read the first two chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the truth nobody cares to tell you, 'you cannot be successful beyond what you know.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Your knowledge is the number one strength of your life. If you want to succeed in business, it is a MUST you read business books.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you will ever succeed in politics, it's a must you read books and biographies on politics and history (not the kind school forced you to read)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever dream to succeed in life, you have to acquire specific knowledge (much of it) about your field and what it takes to succeed there.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have to acquire general knowledge about life and success.\n",
    "\n",
    "He who has ears let him hear what I am telling Africans and the world… knowledge is the master key that opens the door of success and you have to take responsibility for your education if you want to be (truly) educated.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Stocks Vs Bonds – which investment option is better and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a young person, it is important to keep refining your knowledge of investments so that you can take advantage of emerging opportunities. It is only by doing this that you will be able to get your money to work for you instead of leaving it to lay idle in a bank account. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today am going to share with you some important information you need before you start investing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What Are Stocks and How Do They Work?*\n",
    "\n",
    "A stock (or a share) is a small piece of ownership in a business. For instance, in 2008 Safaricom went public and offered every person an opportunity to own a piece of it. Each share was then priced at Ksh.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say Mr. Juma bought stocks worth Ksh.10,000 at that time. So technically Mr. Juma became an owner of Safaricom — and as you know when you become a business owner, you are entitled to a share of its profit at the end of each financial year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What Are Bonds and How Do They Work?*\n",
    "\n",
    "A bond is a debt, and when you buy one you are simply lending the government your money. For example, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) sometimes back rolled out M-Akiba bond that you can buy for as little as Ksh.3,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say Mr. Otieno buys bonds worth Ksh.30,000. So technically Mr. Otieno has lent the government his money — and as you know when you lend money, you are entitled to getting the agreed interest rates (also known as coupons or bond returns).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Which Investment Pays More?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Stocks tend to pay more particularly if you invest in a profitable company. But timing is key. If you buy stocks from a growing company then you can only hope for good returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bonds on the other hand give you relatively less but smooth and guaranteed returns (typically 12.5%). They are a good option if you are a long-term investor especially due to the power of compounding (in the case of zero coupon bonds).\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much Can I Make If I Invest Ksh.10,000?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Stocks can double or triple your money especially if you do the right timing. But on the other hand, if you get it all wrong, then you can as well bite some losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bonds on the other hand can give you as much as 20% returns per annum – and given the power of compound interest rate, they offer great potential for growth especially in the long-term.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Which Option Guarantees Me of Returns?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re looking for “guaranteed” returns then bonds are the best investment option to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, bond prices fluctuate less than stock prices. Depending on how you invest in them, they can offer returns that are guaranteed, or close to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stocks on the other hand are not guaranteed. If the company you have invested in makes losses and declares bankruptcy then you may not get any returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you bought Mumias stocks while they were priced at Ksh.15 and today they are selling at Ksh.3 then your returns may not be anything worth talking about. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand you can hold on, and if the company resurrects, the share prices will rise and all will be well. That's what happened to Safaricom in 2007. Their share prices went down but later after the post election violence their shares went up.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Minimum Investment Required*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can buy bonds worth as little as Ksh.3,000. You can start trading in stock with as little as Ksh.10,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone can invest and this is no longer a privilege of the rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stocks Vs. Bonds – Which Is Better?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonds are better for those who are cautious about taking risks. You are guaranteed to get your investment plus interest back – unless the Government goes bankrupt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides that, tax-free bonds have attractive interest rates which are way above what banks and Saccos offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stocks on the other hand are a good choice for anyone who is ready to take a greater degree of risk. You are guaranteed to grow your money faster provided the company you invest in operates profitably. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the company makes losses or files for bankruptcy then your investment may as well go down the drain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more on how you can invest and profit from government bonds, join our Government Bonds & Tenders Training.\n",

    "Today I will be sharing with you some of my greatest teachers. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this even funnier is that you don’t have to pay a dime to learn from these people and they can teach you things that are far more valuable than what any university can.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Seth Godin*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have told people many times in the past; if you truly want to build a successful business in this age, you must read three of Seth Godin’s books; Purple Cow, Idea Virus, and Tribes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing about this is that all these books are free and you can download them even on Seth Godin’s blogs by searching Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "I read Purple Cow and Idea Virus about three years ago and till today I feel like meeting with Seth Godin to hold him tight to my chest for about five minutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "My business revenue grew by 100% or more just by understanding the concept Seth teaches.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I don’t know any school that could have taught me what I learned from Seth and even if you hate reading books, Seth has so many videos on YouTube which teach the same things that you would find in his books.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Christopher Voss*\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time I listened to Chris Voss it was via his teaching at the Masterclass which was a paid learning platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "But as God would have it, YouTube started recommending his videos for me. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chris is a former FBI hostage negotiator who is now an entrepreneur and the CEO of The Black Swan Group Ltd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chris talks a lot about negotiation and he really knows what he’s talking about, being a former FBI hostage negotiator. \n",
    "\n",
    "You see, negotiation is one of the business skills I advise every entrepreneur to study. While everyone negotiates every day, an entrepreneur negotiates every hour. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a business person you meet with a lot of people, some are good, some are bad and some are selfish. If you don’t know what to say to get what you want, you will be stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why I love to learn about negotiation. Knowing how to negotiate with others can double your income and efficiency as an entrepreneur and Chris Voss is probably one of the best people who can really reach you this skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Jordan Peterson*\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably know Jordan Peterson but maybe you don’t take him seriously. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please do. \n",
    "\n",
    "I consume Peterson’s content almost every day on YouTube. \n",

    "*4. Napoleon Hill*\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, Napoleon is dead. But he’s alive and we are likely to take his eternal gift for granted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do I call Napoleon’s book “eternal gift”? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, Think & Grow Rich has made more people rich than any other book ever written. \n",
    "\n",
    "I read this book in the year 2007 and it saved my life. The problem however is that most humans think new things are better than old things while in fact, nothing is new under the sun. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we have new words to describe things but we will still have to describe the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are among those people who never read Think & Grow Rich or you read it long ago and don’t respect it as much as you do some new books, I challenge you to go and read that book again.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s actually a free book now as it’s in the public domain. \n",

    "*6. Robert Greene*\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometime between the year 2007 and 2008, one of my friends received a text message from his friend which went something like, “If you want to have a meaningful future, you must read ’48 Laws of Power”. \n",
    "\n",
    "We rushed out to look for 48 Laws of Power but when I read it, I hated the book. \n",
    "\n",
    "I suspected such a book must have been written by a devilish human because every book I have ever read was telling me how human beings should be, not how they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hated Robert Greene’s books for many years but later when I re-checked and especially when I listened to Robert speaking, I saw a humble man who decided to teach the reality, not necessarily the ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, people like us but most people won’t. We expect that our boss should appreciate our efforts and commitment but if we appear to be outgrowing them, then, we are in trouble.\n",

    "Today, I have in my library the three most popular books by Robert Greene. \n",

    "\n",
    "Yes, you know this name. He’s everywhere but he also has a good message for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "I like Garry’s message because he focuses on happiness, not materialism. \n",
    "\n",
    "So many people in our world think we need success to acquire loads of things. \n",
    "\n",
    "No, we need progress and success so that we will feel human. \n",
    "\n",
    "Others wish success should be achieved by little effort. No, we have to burn the candle and make sacrifices.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there’s anything I want to achieve with this article, it will be to show some people how blessed we are to be alive today. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just 50 years ago, if you wanted to learn from an expert, you either had to pay a lot of money to go and listen to them or buy their books. \n",

    "Unfortunately, successful entrepreneurs are very scarce and those available have no time to guild you and I.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Books written by the entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurship books is the only solution to the problems and lack of skills anyone of us can encounter.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mitumba business is one of the most profitable businesses in Kenya. According to a Reuters report, an estimate of 100,000 tonnes of mitumba clothes is imported to Kenya annually. \n",
    "\n",
    "These tonnes of imported mitumba generates millions of revenue and jobs for most Kenyan citizens and especially, young people. The best thing about this venture is that you can start the business with less than Ksh.20,000 capital. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have been wondering how you can start a second-hand clothes business, then this article is for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started;\n",
    "\n",
    "*4 factors to consider before starting a mitumba business in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Capital*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start a small mitumba business with roughly Ksh.500 to Ksh.1,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, for a medium mitumba business, you can start with Ksh.20,000 to Ksh.100,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those who would love to start a large mitumba business, arm yourself with more than Ksh.100,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this breakdown, you can clearly tell that your capital will determine the size of mitumba business you can start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Identify the target market*\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to starting any business, it very important to think about your target market. When thinking about selling second-hand clothes, you can create your own target market. You can target your colleagues, neighbours, door to door, villagers or even online marketing among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "The online market is one of the easiest to start compared to physical stores because it spares you the expenses like business licenses, rent, and electricity bills among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "The online market is easy to start as all you need is a Facebook page, Instagram account and WhatsApp group (s). \n",
    "\n",
    "In order for you to gain maximum profit, make sure you give unique advantages that your competitors are not offering. For instance, you can offer to deliver goods to buyers of specific areas or give a discount for items bought online. Just do your research and learn about your competitors and what they are doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to ensure that your items are unique. It will help you increase your chances of making profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "For those with enough capital, however, you can opt for a physical stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "The location should have high traffic. For maximum profits, you can consider selling clothes in a physical location and online as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. The supplier*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting a mitumba business, it is very important to locate a reputable and reliable supplier. You can either buy stock in bales or randomly pick individual items at a wholesale price. \n",
    "\n",
    "For starters, you can go for the latter. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make a profit, the supplier should have reasonable prices. Eastleigh, Muthurwa and Gikomba markets are the main suppliers of second-hand clothes in Nairobi.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Buying stock in bales*\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of picking clothes randomly for resale, you might prefer purchasing the stock in bales. By so doing, you get more stock at very pocket-friendly deals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imported second-hand clothes in Kenya come from European nations, Japan, Australia, Germany, Canada, the UK, China, and the USA among other developed countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The UK supplies the best quality of mitumba clothes, making these clothes slightly expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dubai is also a good source of quality mitumba clothes, but relatively cheaper. \n",
    "\n",

    "A bale of kid’s clothing in China will cost you Ksh.10,000 while in Europe the same bale will cost you Ksh.30,000. However, the difference is that European clothes have higher quality, as opposed to those from China.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is more profitable to import kids’ second-hand clothes because they contain lots of goodies with exception of lighter attire. You can either import mitumba clothes or buy a bale from interior markets like Gikomba.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is the mitumba market saturated?*\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major things that keeps people from engaging in the mitumba venture is thinking that it is already saturated. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the truth is that this market is not saturated but highly profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "With only Ksh.1,000, you are ready to start a small mitumba business and earn at least Ksh.500 profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can tell, this is much better than spending the whole day at home, waiting for someone to notice your letter of application from thousands of others on their desk or even worse stay at home doing nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great opportunity because annually, Kenya imports 100,000 tonnes of mitumba, creating millions of jobs for young people. By targeting middle-income earners, you will be able to earn profit and grow your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "“The only issue in this business is people coming in and expecting to make millions during their first day. They are not open to handling the risks involved in the business,” says Shem Spiesses, a mitumba trader through his marketing page on Facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why mitumba business is a profitable venture*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very wrong to assume that mitumba business is a tedious and costly job with less income. Of course, it takes hard work to make a profit and grow business, but your profit hugely relies on your marketing strategies and commitment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the reasons why mitumba business is a profitable venture.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Easy to start*: In Kenya, you can start the mitumba business with as little as Ksh.5,000 or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ready market*: Second-hand clothes have a high demand in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Variety of clothes*: There are numerous types of clothes that you can choose from in order to start your mitumba business. Depending on your own preference, you can choose to specialize with kids’ men or women clothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*No educational requirements*: In order to start a successful mitumba business, tertiary level education is not a requirement. In Kenya, there are numerous school dropouts who have started the mitumba business and earned millions from it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, business skills are required to put you ahead of the pack.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Grade A*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a grade of mitumba clothes that are almost new. Their condition and quality are untampered with. They are the most profitable but also relatively expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grade B*\n",
    "\n",
    "These second-hand clothes are used, but slightly, leaving them in good condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grade C*\n",
    "\n",
    "These are second-hand clothes that come with minor defects including dents and ink spills. These defects can be corrected before the sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grade D*\n",
    "\n",
    "These second-hand clothes come with major defects that cannot be adjusted by the seller. They are sold the cheapest because of their condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this categorization, Grade A clothes are the most profitable because they feature high quality and almost new condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, various cloth types do well in different locations based on different factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance; investing in jackets in Limuru will be highly profitable because the place is cold, as opposed to having the same investment in a place like Mombasa.\n",

    "\n",
    "Things are really changing for the better online these days, and the number of Kenyan online entrepreneurs is steadily growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people are still too busy looking at closed doors than checking out the legitimate, awesome opportunities that keep unveiling themselves right in front of our eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, life is made in such a way that whenever a door closes, there are always multiple doors opening up.\n",
    "\n",
    "How did the whole Kenyan online entrepreneurship come about? \n",
    "\n",
    "What is shifting the minds of Kenyans from being mere online workers to being astute online business people?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me tell you a story.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started working online in April, 2008. I used to write articles worth $1 (Ksh.100) per 500 words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Those days, there was no one talking about freelance writing online. There were a few doing it, but they kept it top secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I thought I was earning quite well with those $1 pieces. After all, I could do 10 articles a day ($10) and earn Ksh.30,000 in a month. \n",
    "\n",
    "Soon my clients doubled it and started paying $2 per 500 words. I was in heaven.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having an entrepreneurship mindset, I started hiring others for that 1$. The client would pay me $2 and I would make $1 profit per article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a few weeks, i had a team so strong that we could produce up to 75 articles per day. That was a whole $75 per day for me. It was the highest amount I had ever earned or even dreamt of earning at the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a few months before that, some of my friends who we were working online with couldn’t afford much in life. They were struggling to pay rent and buy food for their family. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact they all hated being sick because they couldn’t afford medication.\n",
    "\n",
    "One year later, this little online entrepreneurship enabled them to have some little financial breather.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of my friends like Walter Akolo, CEO http://freelancerkenya.com who we started online business with is now making it big.\n",
    "\n",
    "I stopped the agency thing because of issues managing clients and writers, and after even being conned in the process. I then decided to go for higher paying clients and have only a few writers.\n",
    "\n",
    "After writing a lot, I started asking myself, where are these clients taking all my articles?\n",
    "\n",
    "I did some little online digging and realized that the clients were paying me just $5 or so per article, but they would post these articles to their websites and earn thousands of dollars from their sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then started my blog, which also enabled me to earn thousands of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, many of my friends also started doing online freelancing and after laboring for a while, the same question lingered in their minds.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, entrepreneurship starts with the question below:\n",
    "\n",
    "What are clients doing with all these articles, graphics, websites, apps and transcripts among other things? \n",
    "\n",
    "From that question, many Kenyans are diversifying from just freelancing to being online businesspersons.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will soon write more articles explaining what entrepreneurs are doing and raking in good money online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, don`t forget to join our Government Bonds & Tenders Training.\n",

    "30/04/2022, 1:34 pm - +254 701 711058: *PROFITABLE FOOD BUSINESS IDEAS IN KENYA*\n",
    "\n",
    "The food industry is one of the largest and most in-demand sectors in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually in demand because the population is ever on the increase, thereby providing a ready market. \n",
    "\n",
    "People eat on a regular basis and there is always a demand for all types of food. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many food business ideas in Kenya that you can turn into a great opportunity. \n",
    "\n",
    "They include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Food Supply Chain*\n",
    "\n",
    "Hotels, schools, hospitals, and restaurants need a supply of fresh vegetables, grains, and animal products to keep their businesses running. \n",
    "\n",
    "This brings the need for someone to liaise them with farmers in the village. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can get tenders from schools, hotels, and government organizations to bring them fresh farm produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Popcorn Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Popcorn is a popular snack in Kenya that is easy to make. To get started with this business, you can buy a cheap popcorn-making machine and start selling popcorn. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a business outlet like a retail shop that is strategically located, you can start a popcorn business alongside. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can hawk your popcorns or supply them to shops and kiosks in town or in your neighborhood. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, instead of making popcorn, you can choose to buy corn and package the grain for sale to people who can make their own popcorn.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Cake Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "The cake business is another great food business idea. You can choose to make cakes for birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and other important occasions. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is best to do some research to find out the best places to sell your cakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can decide to sell them in your neighborhood, distribute them to shops, restaurants, and hotels or sell them online. \n",
    "\n",
    "Advertising your cake business will expose you to many potential clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Boiled Eggs, Smokies, and Sausages*\n",
    "\n",
    "The boiled eggs and smokies/sausage business is a very popular food business idea in Kenya. You will find people selling eggs and smokies everywhere especially in market centers and in town. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you will need to buy a selling cart, get an eggs supplier from whom you will be buying your eggs, and where you will be buying your smokies from. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes back we wrote an article on how you can make ksh.48,000 a month with smokies and eggs business in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. A Food Café Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "A fast food café business is a perfect food business idea in Kenya. You can rent out space and have people come to your café to have drinks such as tea and coffee. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want more customers coming in, you can offer drinks alongside snacks such as samosas, bread, biscuits, sandwiches, mandazi, chapati, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have customers who have no time to visit your café premises. In this case, you can offer food delivery services in homes, offices, and other businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to advertise your food delivery business like on social media handles to get many customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Fruit Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Fruits are healthy and starting a fruit salad business or a fruit stall business or fruit juice business is a great idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing about this business is that you can run it alongside another business like a restaurant. \n",
    "\n",
    "When your customers come into your restaurant to eat, they can complement their meals with fruit salad or fruit juice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can decide to hawk your fruit salad & juice and sell it to people at their place of work such as offices, Jua kali artisans or sell it in learning institutions and hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Yoghurt and Ice Cream Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "People love yoghurt and ice cream and it is an in-demand food business idea in Kenya. If you have the skills to prepare yoghurt and ice cream, you can make it in your kitchen and start by selling to your neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not know how to make them, you can learn from a friend, YouTube or take lessons from one of the many colleges, or polytechnics. Alternatively, you can even take an online course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes back we wrote an article on how you can start a small Yogurt Business and scoop 300% returns for each shilling invested.\n",
    "\n",
    "*8. Githeri and Boiled Beans Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Kenyans have busy working schedules and they may not have the time to boil cereals that take too long to cook like githeri and beans. \n",
    "\n",
    "This presents a good food business idea where you can boil beans and githeri and when ready, package and sell to students or adults with busy schedules. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the most of this business, it is best to find a strategic location to run your business. You can start selling boiled cereals near institutions like universities and colleges or near households. \n",
    "\n",
    "*9. Meat Businesses*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many meat businesses you can start in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "Roasted meat or nyama choma is a popular business. You can start a nyama nyoma joint near restaurants. People love to eat roasted meat while enjoying wine or beer. The demand for nyama choma is high making it an excellent food business idea to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also choose to sell roasted or boiled meat all together and customers can choose what to eat. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another excellent meat business is the butchery business. You can get meat in bulk from slaughterhouses to sell in your butchery. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can supply meat to butcheries and big institutions like schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes back we wrote articles on how to start a butchery business in Kenya, how to start a nyama choma business in Kenya and how to start a pork butchery business in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*10. Food Catering Services*\n",
    "\n",
    "Food catering is also a popular food business idea in Kenya, especially during festive seasons. If you want to make the most out of this business, you will need to network with event planners. \n",
    "\n",
    "People at parties such as birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and even burials will need someone to prepare meals for them. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new in the business and you lack networks, you can start small and make use of that friend, colleague, or family member. If they are hosting parties, offer your food catering services at a fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes back we wrote an article on How to start an outside catering business in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*11. Mandazi, Chapati and Samosa Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapati, mandazi, and samosa businesses are also great food business ideas in Kenya. Many people love taking breakfast tea or breaktime tea accompanied by either one of these in the morning. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can start any of these businesses with Ksh.5,000. You can make 50% profit in this business since the demand for mandazi, chapati, and samosa is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "From vibandas, hotels, catering, and supply, to production, people are making millions in the food industry in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the thriving agricultural sector in the country, food is readily available. Since many people are venturing into this business, you need to offer excellent customer service. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, you need to sell quality food and ensure that your business premises are clean and hygienic. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the above, find the best food business idea you start and invest in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don`t forget to join our Government Bonds & Tenders Training.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Doing business with the government or making the government your client could mean lots of advantages to your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most crucial is the assurance that your customer will never go bankrupt or even become insolvent. \n",
    "\n",
    "And while you might want to argue that getting a tender when you are a “small person” who lucks connections is similar to going out on a futile fishing mission on the banks of polluted Nairobi River; there are indeed opportunities available for those who are patient enough and willing to learn from experts.\n",

    "\n",
    "Today I will be sharing with you a topic which interests most of us (or all of us)… how to make money.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, what is money?\n",
    "\n",
    "I know, that question sounds stupid. Since you are not a baby, of course you know the definition of money and what money is. Your teacher in primary or secondary school must have taught you that money is a medium of exchange of goods and services (or something similar).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, listen to my definition of money … money is the reward we get for offering value and making the world a better place.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we see money in the light of my above definition, we will have a better approach for creating wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create wealth, you have to understand that your primary task is to offer the world around you (your street, your city, your country, your village) some value. Riches are only a reward, not a goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain with an illustration I love very much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our families needed eggs and some chickens to slaughter at Christmas, they would start rearing chicks. Though they really didn't care about chicks, they would feed them, shelter them and care for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some time, these chicks would grow up, become chickens and start laying eggs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rich people understand this principle better.\n",
    "\n",
    "You too should understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating wealth is about giving first, then getting rewarded later.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3 ways to make money*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me quickly share with you three ways by which money can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in some illegal ways. I know this is not for you. I am just writing this for both of us to understand this issue of money making very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know people get money by stealing, people get money through political frauds, People get money through hard drugs and some other dirty things like selling fake products.\n",
    "\n",
    "I dont need to tell you… those are odd and risky ways to get money and you wont become (truly) rich from any of the above ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "What value is the money you get in exchange for your peace of mind?\n",
    "\n",
    "It isnt worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way you can get some money is by getting a job.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was nothing bad in getting a job until recently when things started changing in the population and the economy of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last 100 years for example, the whole worlds population was less than 2 billion. Most of the worlds population was in the rural areas and others who were in urban areas were having more companies calling them than they could work with. Remember there was no much technology, so most of the jobs were done by human beings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting a job was interesting and that was the reason why school was the best place to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, things have changed so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "The world's population is now over 7 billion. Technologies are doing most jobs. Good jobs are now very (did I say very very?) scares, so job is no more a good way to create wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, our universities, polytechnics and colleges are still busy teaching our young adults how to be employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "To me, we are very stupid to continue teaching our children how to get jobs when we are all aware that there are no more good jobs. But am happy the government has introduced a new education system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "After I have cleared out some dirty means of getting rich and I have explained the reason why getting a job cannot make you rich, then, the only dependable way to make money (especially in 21st century) is to be a business owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to make money by being an entrepreneur?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, its not a very easy thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ounch! I shouldnt have told you that. I am sorry. I should have told you, “You see, making money is very easy”. Isnt that what most people on the internet say these days? Yet, I mustnt tell you that. I have to tell you the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do I really mean that its not possible to be rich?\n",
    "\n",
    "I know thats what some people will “hear”, though I never said that. Getting all the money you need for your life isnt an impossible dream, but it requires some know-how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making money as a business owner can be by producing a product, selling someone elses product, rendering a service or selling your talent (just as football players, movie artists and musicians are doing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you are selling your own product, another persons product, a service or your talent, you are an entrepreneur.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create wealth as an entrepreneur if you can do these three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. If you can learn.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The number one problem in todays generation and economy is the lack of financial literacy. Most people who ask the question, how can I make money, really are not told where to start. Where to start is to be business minded.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know, you have been “good job minded” all your life. Thats not your fault. Thats the fault of school. Now, you must become business minded. Open your mind to business. Think business. Talk business. Plan business and… read business.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are mindful of something, you will want it to be the number one thing in your thoughts and you will want to know about it… in and out… left and right… up and down. Believe me, if anyone asks me “what is the solution to the problem of poverty and unemployment in Africa?” my answer will be in two words… financial education (or business education).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary reason why there are more poor people in the world than rich people is because most people dont know how to be rich. \n",
    "\n",
    "Read this quote and think about it… “There is a secret psychology of money. Most people dont know about it. Thats why most people never become successful” … T. Harv. Eker.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know someone may have a question here… what if I want to sell my talent as a footballer, musician etc., do I still have to be financially literate? Yes. A musician who doesnt understand marketing and other business concepts may sing good songs, but he/she may not be able to sell one thousand copies of his/her work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many athletes have made millions of shillings and lost all because they really did not understand how to keep money growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a writer who writes the best books, you will need business skills to sell your book and financial skill to keep that wealth growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are most people ignorant about wealth acquisition? Why is it that most people dont know that there are some skills to be acquired in order to be rich?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because school never taught us how to make money and whatever school doesnt teach, most people dont know because they are not ready to learn outside what school teaches. The good news is, reading books about business is very interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business/financial books will not bore you like academic books… because they are always very practical and interesting. I started reading about business when I was around 17/18. I fell in love with business and motivational books to a point where I carried them everywhere I went (even up till now).\n",
    "\n",
    "Back then, when I was in campus, I could read 30-50 books (about business, finance, leadership etc.) every year. Some of my friends would have advised me to avoid failing as a result of reading too many non-academic books, but they couldn`t (since I was the best student in my class).\n",
    "\n",
    "My dear fellow Africans, will you believe me if I tell you the truth? Financial education is the place to start, if truly you want to acquire wealth and become rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "What should you do? Where should you start from?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, read everything we post in our PROFITABLE BUSINESS IDEAS Whatsapp Group. You will be wiser, smarter, and be on your way to be rich after reading all the business articles in our group. After all, they are free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, attend some (If not all) our business trainings that we organize on Whatsapp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, reach out and get some good financial and business books in a nearby bookstore or download them online at pdfdrive.com. \n",
    "\n",
    "About 7 years ago I was reading a book by Brian Sher. Sher said, “The shortest cut to riches is financial education”. He is very right. \n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Be a doer.*\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start acquiring financial education, (almost instantly), your eyes will start opening to money making business opportunities around you. You will start “seeing” gold you never saw before, all around you. When this starts happening, you have to be a doer, an actor, a runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurs are actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are not talkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be faced (or you are already being faced) with the temptation to start big or perfectly. Resist that temptation! Starting a business is rarely smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Sam Adeyemi (a Nigeria motivational speaker) said, “start where you are with what you have”, he was offering a great advice. Most people understand that the best way to acquire riches is to be an entrepreneur, yet they are still waiting, for what? For a perfect moment, great idea, huge capital\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to be a doer, an actor, a runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have got a business idea? Start it little, with all your heart and life. When you start, growing becomes easier. When you start, nature comes to your aid.\n",
    "\n",
    "I came across a powerful quotation that inspired me about 8 years ago. Let me share it with you…\n",
    "\n",
    "“Whatever you do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius and power and magic in it”… Johann Goethe\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Cut failure away from your dictionary.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As an entrepreneur, your opinion about what people call failure must be different. For an average person, failure is when you attempt something and do not succeed at achieving your aim. Business people dont see that as failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years I have been amazed by how “failures” led me to the higher ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most times what you will see happening is that, you attempt something, you are hit by defeat (usually bitter and makes you cry). But that “failure” forces you to think in another direction (and of course, makes you smarter). Right at your new direction lies better success. Its not uncommon to see entrepreneurs who start an entirely different line of business getting wonderfully successful in a new field that “failure” forced them to.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have experienced many “failures” in my entrepreneurial journey. Some of them made me wake up at night and cry, some of them made me to think I was stupid to be in business in the first place while all of them have made me a better person.\n",
    "\n",
    "As someone who desires to make money, you have to cut out the word failure from your own dictionary. You have to see failure as a ladder which has to be climbed to the riches you desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthony Robbins in his book, Unlimited Power, encourages us to learn how to manage frustration. In his own view, the more frustrations you can cope with (and still continue pursuing your dream), the more wealth you will acquire.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conclusion.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If truly you desire to be rich, your primary task is to think about the value you can sell, either as a product, a service or your talent. Any of this may require some hard work, commitment, practice and dedication, but you can be sure you will make money at the end of the rope.\n",

    "\n",
    "Maybe you must have found yourself in a situation where you urgently needed money in the form of a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "At that moment, you could not go to your bank because maybe you have an existing loan, had defaulted on a loan, and on an extreme case, had been listed on CRB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having been listed on CRB meant that you could also not contact any other financial institution, leave alone your bank, for any loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mobile lenders and Apps could also not assist because you are still listed on CRB.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is a situation most Kenyans find themselves in when they need loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the only way you can overcome this financial need is to have someone willing to lend you money without considering your credit history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because let’s face it, if no financial institution is willing to lend you money in Kenya, who can?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course a shylock!\n",
    "\n",
    "You will however need collateral like maybe your TV, fridge, or microwave… anything that has monetary value to get these loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what is called Private Lending Business.\n",
    "\n",
    "This business has thrived in Kenya that it is now among the most profitable businesses in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a large sum of money lying in your bank as deposits, you can start a Private Lending Business and gain interest from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to Start a Private Lending Business in Kenya (Location).*\n",
    "\n",
    "The most pressing financial needs which may require the intervention of Private Lenders are not back at the rural areas but in urban areas. Your Private Lending Business will thrive better in the city or an urban setting than the rural areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Private Lending Business (Requirements).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here comes things that are mandatory for success in the Private Lending Business:-\n",
    "\n",
    "*Identify the need for private lending*\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t just go ahead lending money to people who might as well not have needed your intervention. This is business and you need to first identify an exploitable gap. People will always have financial needs anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Register your Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to register your micro-lending company with the appropriate agency. You will also need to obtain all the necessary licenses and permits. And most importantly, you must fulfil legal obligations required by your county government to avoid falling into problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Draft contract forms*\n",
    "\n",
    "Signed contracts are very recognizable by the law. You only need the person you are lending money to sign a contract form and you can sue them in a court of law incase of anything (which rarely happens if you have collateral) and you will still be safe, not unless it is found out that you forged a document for fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not forge signatures – let your clients sign the contract forms themselves. Contract forms are the only thing that makes the agreement between you and the borrower binding and legal.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Determine interest rates and the maximum amount you can lend*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to determine how much you will charge on your borrowed money in terms of what duration. Most people doing private lending offer loans at 10% to 15% daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your unique circumstances and the market conditions also, determine the rate at which you will charge interest. You also need to determine how much your limit is, depending on how much you have to offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Determine valid collaterals*\n",
    "\n",
    "Any client you lend money is a potential defaulter, no matter how much you trust them. You will need collateral when they borrow money, which you will retain or sell if they default, or return to them after they pay back the loan and interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to determine which collaterals you will take, which may as well be in line with your existing business like electronics if you are running an electronics shop. The collateral you take must be of much more worth than the amount the client is seeking to borrow, to ensure you are protected in case they default.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Market your private lending business*\n",
    "\n",
    "You had already identified a market gap and known that most people would need your private lending services. By word of mouth, social media, or any other local means, spread the word that you are offering such services. Let potential clients know that they can come to you when they need the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Recap:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let clients know that they will need collateral of much more worth than the amount they are seeking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure clients sign the contract forms themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure clients understand the terms of your service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test all collaterals to ensure they are in good working condition and not faulty before handing in the cash to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let all clients prove ownership of the item they bring as collateral (can provide receipts) to avoid the possibility of having been stolen.\n",
    "As you start, remain local to avoid much drama.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much capital do you need to start a private lending business in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have about Ksh.250,000 to Ksh.500,000 or more lying in your bank deposit accounts, you have enough to venture into private lending.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How profitable is a private lending business in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you lend out your Ksh.250,000 to Ksh.500,000, that is in small quantities to various people for 30 days with 15% daily interest, then at the end of the month you expect Ksh.1,125,000 to Ksh.2,250,000. Your money grew by a whole 450%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you don’t lend out the whole amount, whatever amount you lend will grow by 450% at the end of the month. Where else do you earn 450% on your money, if not in private lending?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel the interest rate is high, you can lower it and still make money.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Private lending is one of the most lucrative ventures in Kenya today.\n",
    "If you do it right, you will smile all the way to the bank. If you got extra money to spare, join the club, pay the price, and make your millions..\n",

    "Let each partner run his /her business. This will ensure that the one in charge of the business is solely responsible. Most of the conflict come as a result of blame game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disagreement on the best way to run a business results in collapse. As long as only one person runs the business it is easier to account for.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Chip In Financially*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the only way the two parties may come together to uplift one another. In case one party's business is not doing well, it is necessary to boost one another. This doesn’t mean that the running of the business will shift. It is just for financial support to avoid fall of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Give Account Of Progress*\n",
    "\n",
    "This will ensure that the other partner is aware of what is happening in each business. The aim of this is not to take charge of your partner’s management. It is solely to enable each other understand the business better. In case one is sick or may not be able to operate in a day everything moves on well.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Keep Records*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every business needs account of records. At the end of the day one needs to figure out how the business is doing. This can only be achieved through recording of day’s activities. This gives smooth flow of business. Also it enables one to know when to replenish stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reconcile The Accounts*\n",
    "\n",
    "Books of accounts are a must for any business. Therefore make it a routine to have proper controls. The reconciliations may be done daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly depending on the business nature. This is every business watchdog to curb any loopholes in the business. If need be involve a professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It Is Our Business At The End Of Day*\n",
    "\n",
    "It ensures proper business management in that each partner is aware of the activities going on. Even if not fully running the business, at least the slightest idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way in case of challenges it is easily solved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have an open mind and ready to ask for guidance. Also it becomes a platform to table the challenges and strengths of the business. Any improvement should be done together.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It Is A Way Of Diversifying Risks*\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that each partner runs their own business, it is a way of mitigation of risk. This is so because if one business collapses the other continues. Thus, the risks are diversified. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to stabilize the family's financial income. Losses in business are inevitable. If the same happens the family remains stable. Therefore, in case one business collapses the other is intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally,*\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in jobs segregation of duties is always important. It is good to know your stand in every idea or your role in the family business or businesses. \n",

    "\n",
    "Bamboo farming is popular in China and the US where it is grown for medicinal, ornamental purposes and feeding of panda. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back home, this type of farming is peaking with potential demand coming from construction companies, landscapers and even beer manufacturers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Do I Get Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtually anyone can venture into this line of business. Actually, there are no stiff requirements for getting started. \n",
    "\n",
    "You only need adequate land (at least 1 acre) and the right information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of bamboo plants is that they can grow in any region where maize, wheat or any other crop that belongs to the grass family thrives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some quick tips for choosing the ideal piece of land for planting bamboo:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Well-drained soil; not in a swampy area\n",
    "\n",
    "*Spacious piece of land with adequate sunlight\n",
    "\n",
    "*Spacing of 5ft in between plantlets\n",
    "\n",
    "*Moderate supply of rainfall\n",
    "\n",
    "*Soil pH – 6.5 – 8 pH\n",
    "\n",
    "*Where To Get Seedlings*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get good seedling from a certified nursery in your area. However, before you buy, it is important you talk to a Ministry of Agriculture extension officer in your region. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Kitil bamboo farm in Isinya Kajiado County is one of the few providers of bamboo seedlings and plantlets in the region. \n",
    "\n",
    "The average price per seedling is Ksh.180 to Ksh.250 – this can change depending on the amount of seedlings bought.\n",
    "\n",
    "*After how long can I expect my money back?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Bamboo farming as a long-term investment – pretty much the same way you would buy a plot of land and leave it to gain market value before re-selling it for profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bamboo plantlets normally take 3 to 4 years to mature.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much do I need to spend?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to plant bamboo on say a one-acre piece of land, you would need to spend the following (estimated) amounts:\n",
    "\n",
    "200 Bamboo Seedlings x Ksh.200 = Ksh.40,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Tilling of land and labor = Ksh.25,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Fungicides = Ksh.10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Transport and Harvesting = Ksh.50,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Miscellaneous = Ksh.10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "That brings you to an estimated total of Ksh.135,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much can I expect in return*\n",
    "\n",
    "Each bamboo plantlet produces multiple shoots during its lifetime. For example, a young plant may produce three shoots within two months time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next season, those three shoots plus the mother plant may produce three shoots each and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fast-forward four years, the single plant you planted will have produced sixty canes stretching up to thirty feet in height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us say you sell each pole at a throw-away-price of Ksh.100, how much will you get from a single plant (which you bought for Ksh.200)? 60×100 = Ksh.6,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, Multiply Ksh.6000 by the number of shoots in your farm, how much do you get? Ksh.6000 X 200 = Ksh.1,200,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only disadvantage with bamboo plants would be that they are only commercially useful from year 4 to year 6 after planting.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is there ready market for bamboo in Kenya and Africa?*\n",
    "\n",
    "While market is readily available, you may have to do a bit of marketing just to create sustainable demand for your product. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three years that you would have to wait for the crop to mature should be enough for you to create a buzz around your farm so that you are assured of earning from your sweat when the day of harvest arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from direct marketing, you can get a little innovative to create and sell bamboo products. Examples of products you can produce and sell to a ready-market include bamboo matchsticks, toothpicks, bamboo charcoal or even bamboo beer. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create nice art products with it and start selling to individuals and corporate in your area.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally;*\n",
    "\n",
    "As someone once said, opportunities come dressed in overalls. Who knows, maybe your first million is stashed right in the middle of a bamboo thicket. \n",
    "\n",
    "As I conclude this article, I would like to invite you to join our Government Bonds & Tenders Training.\n",

    "\n",
    "Most economic transformations start from the grassroots\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant portion of Africa’s population and agricultural resources (including large swaths of unused arable land) are located in rural areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if the potential of the continent’s rural areas is developed and harnessed, Africa could set off an agricultural revolution that would lead to significant increases in food production, job creation, and economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, since the 1990s, several countries have transformed their economies by investing in, and transforming, their rural areas. China, Thailand, Malaysia and Costa Rica are only a handful of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phylis Wangari Kanja decided to quit a top marketing job in a bank at age 25 to start  an agribusiness venture. \n",
    "\n",
    "She started Elim Gardens Spring Farm, where she engages in horticulture and dairy farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "“When I decided to relocate from Nairobi, some of my family members and friends thought I was crazy. They told me that I was not going to last one month in the village.” Wangari says.\n",
    "\n",
    "She did her degree in public relations in 2010 at Inoorero University. She then started doing small businesses in Nairobi and her last job was as a marketer in a bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "An opportunity to get into farming came when her parents decided to dump maize farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I was employed and my parents work in Nairobi and there was nobody living here, so maize was a convenient crop to grow. I have always had a passion for farming so after the harvest of maize, my parents decided to venture into horticulture. That is when I decided to move to Njoro and make farming my full time job,” she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wangari is quick to add that before you venture into farming, information is key and one must do a lot of research. “I wanted to grow watermelon but after doing my research, I learnt that this weather is not suitable for watermelon. It’s important to understand the weather, type of soil and what crops can and cannot do well in the area you intend to farm,” Wangari advises, adding that she settled for tomatoes, vegetables and dairy farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wangari has planted tomatoes, kales, cabbages, spinach and green peas in her farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "She got about Sh.150,000 from the first harvest of tomatoes from one and half acres of land.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tomatoes are selling at Sh.75 per kilo but Wangari sells using crates, at a cost of between Sh.1,600 and Sh.1,800.\n",
    "\n",
    "She adds that black spots and pests are some of the challenges she encounters in her project, but through the use of pesticides, she has been able to realize decent profits. “We also have kales on two and half acres. Currently the demand for kales is low as most people have planted them in their farms due to the ongoing rains,” she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "The market price for a bag of kales has gone as low as Sh.500 from between Sh.1,200 and Sh.1,800.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her main market is Egerton University, which buys about four bags of kales in a day at Sh.800 each. She gets about Sh.22,400 every week from the university. She also sells to individuals every Thursday. “However, the university market is tricky because it’s only there when the students are in school,” she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wangari has also planted carrots, capsicum and cucumber. In addition, she has some lettuce, coriander and green pepper in the nursery. The farm also has fruit trees like tree tomatoes and avocados.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wangari is currently harvesting green peas. So far, she has sold 15 (90kg) bags, with a kilo fetching Sh.35, earning her Sh.45,000. She is expecting to do another harvest in a week’s time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crop diseases have been a major challenge but she says having a farm manager who is knowledgeable on horticulture is a plus. Besides the farm manager, she also employs six women on a casual basis and pays them Sh.200 per day each.\n",
    "\n",
    "When she was starting the dairy farming project, she consulted an officer from the department of agriculture in Njoro on how to construct a proper dairy shed.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I started with constructing a zero grazing unit from my savings and also bought a one year and ten months old pedigree Friesian heifer at Sh.75,000. I have since added two more heifers which I bought at Sh.40,000 and Sh.60,000 respectively,” says Wangari.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, she is yet to get back her returns as two of the cows have just calved, one is being milked and produces 15 litres a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "She has also dug a borehole at Sh.2 million where she gets water for irrigation. She also supplies water to the neighboring community. \n",
    "\n",
    "“We supply water to about 70 households in Njukirie, Belba and Lions areas with each household paying a minimum of between Sh.400 and Sh.500 per month. We are working to connect people at Michukiria area and our target is to supply 200 households,” Wangari says.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "Farming pays and at the end of it all, you will get back your money if you do it right and have the right information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom line is, you must have a passion and do not venture into farming without information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do research by visiting farmers, the Kenya Agricultural Research and Livestock Organization and agriculture shows as the more information you get, the more equipped you will be to handle the challenges.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes back, I was thinking of some of my big goals and (just like you) I became overwhelmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "“How can I possibly go through all these, to move from here, to there?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Just a few minutes after thinking, something came to my mind; Why worry about years to come?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why worry about several months to come?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why even worry about next month?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decide on what you have to do now, today and tomorrow and be disciplined to do just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do what you should do, daily, just daily, to move closer to your goals, and years to come will take care of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume you are earning Ksh.50,000 per month now and set a goal to be earning Ksh.500,000 per month few years from now.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the distance between where you are and where you want to be, it will be overwhelming and seem impossible, then, you will be discouraged and give up.\n",

    "Don’t!\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Read 1 business/finance book every month (meaning reading just about 10 pages every day).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make friends with business minded people (or owners) and meet to talk every Saturday (it could be on phone too)\n",

    " \n",
    "Ethiopia is known for many things, it is home to some of the world’s best long-distance runners, a fast-growing economy and a vibrant textile industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Talking about textile, Ethiopia’s leather industry has of late been attracting all manner of international and local shoe manufacturers who have turned the Made in Ethiopia brand into a global phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a small businessman or investor, you can be part of this game-changer by importing Ethiopian made leather shoes and retailing them for a profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefit of doing this is that cost of doing business is cheaper than say importing from Turkey, Italy or China.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because Ethiopia is a member of COMESA you can expect to pay friendly custom duties when bringing your cargo into the country. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is of course in addition to the fact that it takes fewer days to receive your cargo because of geographical proximity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Know What You Want*\n",
    "\n",
    "A wise businessman is one who first identifies existing market needs prior to investing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, if you are planning to start importing leather shoes and accessories from Ethiopia, it is best to first identify what the local market is looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Are they looking for men official shoes, casual shoes, women or kids shoes?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Shop Widely and Wisely*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have two options here. First option is to book a return flight to Addis Ababa for routine shopping and network building. Such a trip would cost you roughly about Ksh.65,000 (Ksh.50,000 for ticket, Ksh.15,000 other expenses from Nairobi to Addis and back). \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand if you are operating on a tight budget you can choose to shop online. However, not all manufacturers and wholesalers are available online. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the few examples of names that you can engage with online.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ramsay Shoe Factory\n",
    "\n",
    "*Anbessa Shoe Company\n",
    "\n",
    "*Duka Leather\n",
    "\n",
    "Other manufacturers and supplies that would require a physical visit are Huajian Shoe Factory, George Shoes, YED Wuha and Sole Rebels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Always request for sample of product first when ordering online.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Making An Order And Getting Your Stuff Home*\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have done thorough shopping and bargaining you can have the wholesaler pack and send your goods through any of the courier services linking Addis Ababa to your hometown. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here you can link up with DHL, Excel Cargo, Freight in Time Ltd, Salihiya Cargo or any other freight company for assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Paying Customs*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your goods are delivered at the airport or sea port, you will receive a call from the courier company advising you on the amount of taxes to pay. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, because Ethiopia is a member of COMESA you will be saved from the worries of hefty duty. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will only collect your goods after clearing with the customs department after which you can go ahead and sell them to your target market.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Just How Profitable Is The Business Of Importing & Retailing Shoes From Ethiopia?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This business can be highly profitable if you have the numbers and if you price your shoes accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "One good thing is that Ethiopian shoes so far have a good reputation for being hand-made and comprising of pure animal leather. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can capitalize on this good name to charge a premium. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will cost you about Ksh.1,500 to import a pair of shoes into the country, then you can sell this between Ksh.2,500 to 3,500 and above. That is about Ksh.1,500 in net profit per shoe after you deduct all other expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the secret here lies in sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge however is that because this is an open market, anybody can start this business and therefore competition may become stiff with time. \n",
    "\n",
    "But… competition is a must-have in any industry… the key is to build a firm clientele that will give you long-term business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, in addition to shoes you can also import wallets, belts and other fast moving goods that have a leather finishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I conclude this article, I would like to invite you to join our Government Bonds & Tenders Training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called *GOVERNMENT BONDS & TENDERS TRAINING* \n",

    "\n",
    "Have you ever paused for a moment and thought to yourself “I must be doing something wrong with my life, how comes I don’t have a single profitable investment running under my name despite working diligently for all those years?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you have the zeal and willingness to invest… but somehow, things seem not to be going your way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you even have a job, with a steady monthly salary and you do your best to save something at the end of the month but still somehow you have not been making any meaningful progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are in business, despite toiling and moiling all your life, you still can’t narrate any success stories worthy of a gossip blogger’s attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a painful reality that most of us prefer not to talk about. It yields a sense of hopelessness and can easily make you wonder what your \n",
    "purpose in life is.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hand-to-mouth kind of lifestyle is the biggest enemy of development. Unfortunately, most of us lead this kind of life due to the high dependency ratio in this part of the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "You find that a typical hard-worker, let’s call him Mr. X, receives his salary every 30th of the month. He rushes to the bank to pay rent and on his way out he receives a text from his house-wife concerning a few items lacking at home. \n",
    "\n",
    "So he immediately walks into the nearest supermarket for some household shopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "While at it, Mr. X remembers that his mum had called him a week earlier requesting for money to run a few errands back in the village. \n",
    "\n",
    "So he walks to the nearest Mpesa shop and sends something. \n",
    "\n",
    "On his way out, he passes by the nearest wines and spirits outlet to restock his mini-fridge with a whole month’s supply of liquor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next Sunday, Mr. X will attend church whereby you have to contribute some hefty sums in order to receive blessings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. X has not even paid for his kids' school fees and medicare. His inlaws and siblings are on his neck. And at the same time he still owes his local kiosk guy and butcher a tidy sum from last month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such is the reality of life around here. We have people busy working but with little or no progress to show. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why? \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the moment you start making a few cents in your new job or business, you come face to face with routine demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is unlike other parts of the world where the society naturally gives you an opportunity to thrive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Around here, once you start showing signs of progress, the society naturally starts to feed on the embryo of your success. You become stunted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating opportunities for others to succeed, we create cycles of dependency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Needless to say, many of the would-be good investors end up stuck in this rat race. This way of life means we end up creating an economy full of consumers instead of producers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch-out so that you don’t end up living a hand-to-mouth lifestyle forever. Plan your life in such a way that you are making progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not telling you to evade responsibilities. All I am trying to tell you is that, if you ever have dreams of becoming a great investor someday, you must dodge this trap, somehow.\n",

    "\n",
    "The cost of living in Kenya has shot up in the last decade and continues to be on the rise. This has seen food prices go up everywhere and people are desperately looking for means to sustain themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any means of relief is highly appreciated by Kenyans.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is no secret that Kenya’s staple food, kales and maize, have also shot up in price. Maize flour prices in the shops are becoming unaffordable as new prices are announced every now and then. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many factors that contribute to the rise of maize flour which includes changes in the transportation sector and regional climate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amid all these chaos arises an opportunity that you can capitalize on. Recent research has shown that demand for un-sifted maize flour is high since packed maize flour is proving to be expensive on a commoner’s pockets. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can seize the opportunity and start a posho mill in your local area. Posho milling business can be lucrative if strategically placed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, you will learn on how to set up a successful posho milling business at the lowest cost possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Getting started*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every start-up needs to minimize on its spending for the business to grow. When setting up a posho mill, you have to minimize your spending on the machinery.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of posho millers in the market that you can use. Electric and diesel fueld posho milling machines. They both depend on your budget and where your mill will be located.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the area or spot you plan to set-up your business lacks electricity then it is advisable to buy a diesel powered miller. \n",
    "\n",
    "Electric ones can be used in areas that have electricity. You should survey the area you plan to set up the mill before purchasing a miller. You don’t want to end up with an electrically powered miller in an area that lacks electricity or has frequent power black outs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Installation*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not advisable trying to install the posho millers by yourself. Let professionals handle this for you. In most cases, the installation is done by the people whom you buy from but in case you find yourself lacking this service, seek help from those who have been in this business before, probably a qualified technician. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might install the miller wrongly which might result in injuries, breakdowns or reduce the space of your premises unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Space*\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step will be identifying a suitable space in the area you intend to set up the posho mill. Make sure the place is well situated near a road for exposure to passersby. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not go for places where the mill is not visible. If you find a spot that is not next to a road then make sure you put signposts next to a road to direct people to your posho mill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space can turn out to be expensive depending on the number of millers and their size you intend to have at the mill. Make sure you look for a place that is strategically placed and affordable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider yourself lucky if you nail yourself some space at a junction with busy traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Where posho mills can work greatly*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Suburbs* — you are likely to run a successful posho mill in the suburbs. Such areas are highly populated and many families living in these areas try to minimize their food expenditure as much as they can. Regulate your price to gain more customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Industrial areas* — you can set up a profitable posho mill business in an industrial area too. The only disadvantage of setting in such an area is that you will have to source for clients from outside before your business picks. But once people get to know of your posho mill, business will boom.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Up-country* — very few people living up-country buy sifted maize flour from shops. Most consume un-sifted maize flour and this makes up-country the best place to set-up a posho mill. The scarcity of posho mills in these areas also makes the market favorable. Expect good business during the time of harvest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the mill is up and running, it is time to add a few things to boost your income. Some of the things you can consider adding in include cereals that you can sell in the front area of your mill. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can as well bring maize to sell to your customers which will see you earn a good profit on every sack of maize sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best things about this business is that very little goes to waste. You can still find a market for the left-over from the mill. You can sell the leftovers to animal farmers who can pay a good price for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Potential clients*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can expand your business to a wider market. Some of those you can approach include:-\n",
    "\n",
    "*Schools\n",
    "*Prisons\n",
    "*Orphanages\n",
    "*Farmers\n",
    "*Traders\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have connections with schools, orphanages, and prisons you will have to purchase maize in bulk, mill it and then sell it to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your business is likely to grow with time as people spread the word about its existence through word of mouth. You will need less marketing to manage a successful posho business since people will refer others to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dealing with competition*\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are is more than one posho mill in your area then create a strategy on how to outsmart your competitors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Delivering good service and charging affordable rates is one way of doing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other way is introducing a variety of things. It would be a great idea to have cereals for sale at your mill too.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "As we always tell you, there’s no marathon race that has ever been won by those who did not start the race. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you like the idea discussed above and you have what it takes to actualize it… then don’t wait to start… just do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our Government Bonds & Tenders Training.\n",

    "05/05/2022, 7:44 pm - +254 754 839228: *I STARTED MY BUSINESS WITH PEANUTS FROM GRANDMOTHER*\n",
    "\n",
    "Esther Kojwang is a 26 year old mother of one, a Hotel and Hospitality Management graduate currently pursuing an MBA. \n",
    "\n",
    "She is the owner of Eastnat Limited, which deals in the production of homemade peanut butter, natural honey, shea butter, ghee and coconut oil. She shares about her entrepreneurial journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The idea:*\n",
    "\n",
    "After trying a hand on several businesses that failed, trying employment which left me so dissatisfied and unhappy, my young, stressed and broke self quit my job and travelled to the village to pay my grandmother a visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being around grandmas has this calming effect. It’s therapeutic. It was groundnut harvesting season hence she sent me to the shamba to go harvest. \n",
    "\n",
    "While at the shamba, I took more selfies than harvesting, posted them on facebook and once my friends saw them they said they wanted me to bring them nuts of which I promised to deliver. \n",
    "\n",
    "I not only promised raw nuts, but also peanut butter.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What happened next:*\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not know how or where I would get a machine to grind the peanut butter in bulk but luckily, my sister Lorraine came in handy. \n",
    "\n",
    "She told me where I could hire a machine and grind my products. I hired a machine that helped me start off.\n",
    "\n",
    "A week later I was back in Nairobi with 76 jars of pre-ordered peanut butter. I sold them in three days. That was a sign that my idea was viable.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Running a start-up:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Money is always the biggest challenge that hinders people from starting a business, but once you decide to give it a shot you realize that money is the least of your problems; creating value is the biggest challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a good idea in that it has a social impact hence creates value, you are good to go. Growth will follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would love my business to grow at a faster rate but that requires a huge capital input.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been bootstrapping and ploughing back a large percentage in order to possess the equipment needed to process efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "I bought my own machines last year and have been processing the products from my house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since mine is a small business, I rely on one person to do my deliveries. If he happens to be away, deliveries become very difficult and too expensive as this forces me to hire riders. \n",
    "\n",
    "I intend to purchase my own motorbikes to make deliveries faster and more affordable. \n",
    "\n",
    "I deliver countrywide and have customers as far as Uganda. In this case, the various courier companies come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Where I am not:*\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not yet a millionaire, but at least I am paying my own bills and keeping my business afloat. Business is a sacrifice whereby in the initial stages you work round the clock, always thinking of ways of getting better.\n",
    "\n",
    "I envision Eastnat being the number one producer of organic food products in Kenya. I hope to expand my business and sell a wider range of natural products with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*My tip:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurship is a learning process. You can never learn everything you need to be an entrepreneur before you begin. If you try that, you will forever postpone starting up. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best thing is to start now, make mistakes, learn from them and do better tomorrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I tried four businesses before and they all failed. Each time I failed, I thought I would never try again but I guess I was wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, patience is a value that all entrepreneurs must have. If you are not patient, then train yourself to be patient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurship can be very trying hence without patience one can easily give in.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am passionate about entrepreneurship and it really makes me happy to see people in my age group or even younger going into business, especially manufacturing. \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe our country’s economy would be better only if we made Kenyan and bought Kenyan.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally* \n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you are inspired by Esther Kojwang `s business success story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, nothing good comes on a silver platter. Don’t just sit there and complain. Start small and dream big.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ball is in your court. Even those big companies you see today were once small ideas that seemed too difficult to implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "So psyche yourself up and go for it – all the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our Government Bonds & Tenders Training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called *GOVERNMENT BONDS & TENDERS TRAINING* \n",

    "\n",
    "Doing business with the government or making the government your client could mean lots of advantages to your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most crucial is the assurance that your customer will never go bankrupt or even become insolvent. \n",
    "\n",
    "And while you might want to argue that getting a tender when you are a “small person” who lucks connections is similar to going out on a futile fishing mission on the banks of polluted Nairobi River; there are indeed opportunities available for those who are patient enough and willing to learn from experts.\n",

    "\n",
    "When I arrived at the fast-growing Tassia estate, I could not help but take notice of the extremely hot weather that dominates the Embakasi plains.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a long journey through the busy Mombasa road, veering off at the North Airport road and onwards to the bustling neighbourhood that’s about three blocks away from the Embakasi military barracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, I was optimistic because I knew the woman I was going to meet, in these very plains, would give me a story of hope. Hope that could re-awaken the sleeping giant that resides in each and every one of us.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I walk through an iron-sheet gate following the directions ‘whatsapped’ to me by Tycrose Keeru. She is hard at work at her latest construction site, a three-storied rental building.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sorry, I know the sun is quite hot in this side of the capital” says Tycrose as she leaves her team to welcome me to her workstation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I acknowledge her greetings, I realize she is still wearing her apron and a yellow helmet in such sweltering conditions. You have to be extremely disciplined to remain in your work gear irrespective of the weather. Her face is sprinkled with a greyish substance, which given her profession, I assume is fresh concrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "We walk together to the construction site where I meet her colleagues who seem extremely busy as if working to meet a tight deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "I figured out, my time-wasting tactics were not welcomed here and that I had to immediately get down to the business of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We just finished preparing the slab for that house over there” mentions Tyrcrose as she points towards a neighboring upcoming flat. “We have left it to cure for a few days and for now we are focusing on finishing this one here. The client has been looking for me for days and so I just decided to give her my full-time attention at this juncture” she adds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tycrose is clearly a busy woman. But as she narrates further, her journey has not been a walk in the park.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few years back, she was employed at the airport as a security guard. She worked extremely hard and managed to purchase a piece of land in the vast lands adjacent to the airport. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few years later she constructed a house and prepared for a happily-ever-after kind of life. After all, she had managed to do what most highly-paid employees only dream about.\n",
    "\n",
    "But her moment of relief was short-lived. A few years down the line she learned that she had been a victim of yet another one of the many Nairobi land-scams. \n",
    "\n",
    "A court had ruled that the land (in fact the entire neighbourhood) was acquired illegally and had to be repossessed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Long story short, all her earthly possessions were demolished and destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make matters even worse, she was retrenched from her job that same year as the company she was working for was downsizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "With no home to run to and no job to help her meet basic needs, she felt like her life had hit a snag. The psychological burden was too heavy to carry for the single-mother of two who reckons even developed suicidal thoughts at one time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Her health deteriorated. The meagre savings she had set aside quickly diminished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several years of self-denial and untold suffering sent her into a dark abyss. But nonetheless, faced with the realities of life, she had to sober up, dust herself once again and move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "So she started applying for jobs. Several months of being turned down and tens of empty promises down the line were all it took for her to learn that her dream of securing formal employment was just that – a dream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then a friend approached her and requested if she could accept the job of fetching water for construction sites – a difficult job despised by everyone in the construction industry as it requires too much energy and pays little.\n",
    "\n",
    "But nonetheless, she took it up just so that she could make ends meet.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We used to be paid Ksh.100 for each 200 litre tank of water we fetched. On a good day I used to make Ksh.300” she recalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that she was a woman trying to out-muscle a male dominated career, she faced all manner of criticism. Some even wondered why she could not look for a more “womanly” job.\n",
    "\n",
    "But just before the critics got the better of her, a contractor took notice of her diligence and employed her as a KYM (street name for one who does all the spade work at a construction site).\n",
    "\n",
    "“The job required you to be physically fit and given that my health was still poor, I really had it rough,” narrates Tycrose shaking her head as if to shed-off the bad memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a naturally curious person, she worked closely with experienced masons which helped her learn fast. Tapping into her formal working experience, she was quick to build a rapport with key people in her industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Kuza Biashara rolled out its free digital literacy program for masons, she was quick to apply. And as a top student, she managed to graduate with a dazzling certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "With her confidence renewed, she knew it was the ultimate time to make her move. She quit being employed as a mason and set out to start her own construction company.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I have registered a company by the name Tycpa Contractors. And although we are just getting started, I have so far managed to create jobs for 5 employees.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Her company has so far overseen the completion of 7 construction projects and she currently has several ones underway. \n",
    "\n",
    "She also supplies building materials like cement and ballast on order – a venture that she says has ignited her passion to open a hardware shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "And although she admits that surviving in a male dominated environment has not been an easy ride, she beams with hope that her dreams are just gathering momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Don’t despise humble beginnings. Had I not accepted the job of fetching water for construction sites, I could not have been where I am today. Yet I am still working on my dream and I hope to grow my construction company into a national outfit.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Our 30 minute interview came to an end and I had to leave her to catchup with the rest of the team. Her phone was constantly beeping and I knew that I was already “eating” into her precious time.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even as I made my way back to the office, her story kept reminding me of just how important it is to be adaptive and full of hope. \n",
    "\n",
    "It really doesn’t matter how big the hurdles life places on your way are, as long as you are willing to keep trying, there’s absolutely no situation that’s insurmountable.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I conclude this article, I would like to remind you that we only have 3 days remaining before we start our Government Bonds & Tenders Training.\n",

    "\n",
    "It’s not a secret. The poorest people on Earth are people who work the hardest (at least, with their bones)\n",
    " \n",
    "Go to companies and factories. Visit any company you know.\n",
    " \n",
    "Look for people who work hardest and you will see the sad picture.\n",
    " \n",
    "But wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do I mean you should be lazy?\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "I mean you should work less with your bones and more with your brain.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you truly want to become a successful entrepreneur, you will have to discover a wonderful business idea to build your business on.\n",
    " \n",
    "But that is just the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you discover a great business idea, you will need a million other small ideas to grow and build a successful company.\n",
    " \n",
    "As an entrepreneur, you need an idea every day (EVERY day) of your life and any day you don’t come up with new idea(s) is as good as no day.\n",
    " \n",
    "You must keep on improving your business and operations (and you must do so very fast to beat competitions)\n",
    " \n",
    "If this is true (which is true), how can you come up with new ideas, day after day?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you need to work less with your bone and more with your brain.\n",
    " \n",
    "First, you need to feed your brain some good foods.\n",
    " \n",
    "You need to read and listen to creative people.\n",
    " \n",
    "You need to supply your brain the seed with which it’s going to think.\n",
    " \n",
    "Second, you must allow your brain to think.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working 14 hours every day, 7 days a week will not make you rich (you are lucky if it doesn’t make you the poorest man in your town).\n",
    " \n",
    "Take time to read good books (feed your mind)\n",
    " \n",
    "Take time to free your mind from labour of work.\n",
    " \n",
    "Sit alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Walk around in lonely places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sit under a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a reason why Napoleon Hill named his book “Think and Grow Rich” and not “Work and Grow Rich”\n",

    "\n",
    "Everybody wants to make money.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s not the problem, you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real issue with making money is that… everybody wants to make it FAST… very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Warning:* please, I want to beg you. What I will share with you here in the article will be like bitter leaves for your body. Though it’s very good for your health, it will be bitter in your mouth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick money is a myth… a lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only way to make money quickly is to go against the law and morality (I.e. becoming a thief or a scammer or a drug dealer). If you hate being any of the above, you may not have any manna from heaven, without work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are living in a world where most people are exposed to excessive movies and television shows, most of us have been unconsciously brainwashed to think that we can make money quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since most movies will show us how a lady gets lucky by marrying a politician or business man’s son or how a guy starts a business and becomes rich instantly, many of us have programmed our minds in the expectation of quick wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also in the real world, it’s common to hear the story of how someone became wealthy “by luck”… even when it was never luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have some experiences about this so let me share one or two with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few years ago I was on a business visit at Obafemi Awolowo University (one of the leading universities in Nigeria).\n",
    "\n",
    "While I was in that campus, i sat near some very brilliant students. One of them was studying Law, the other Pharmacy and others some wonderful courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "These near-25 years old students were very brilliant in the academic side of the world, but they were dumb in the understanding of how financial success is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "They were talking about Dangote (now the richest man in Africa) and they were reproducing the lies they have heard from some ill-informed bloggers and news men.\n",
    "\n",
    "They were saying, “He got his money by luck” “he got his money through political frauds”, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I don’t have any special affection for Dangote and I’m not saying he wasn’t lucky or got some political influence, I am here to tell you that beyond all those things, there are prices anyone must pay to attain wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "One big problem about creating wealth is that, the price is always in the secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "By this I mean, when people are struggling to make money, working 16 hours a day, making business mistakes, failing and crawling, the public eye is never on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not even my family members know 5% of what I have gone through in the business world, training, reading, trying and failing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if tomorrow they find my name among the richest Africans, they will be amazed. “How did he get #100 billion?”, “Didn’t we know him and how he started?”, “he must have gotten some luck somewhere”.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "It took Michael Dell years of trying and failing in assembling a computer. In those years, even his parents were not in support of his vision, so how do you expect him to tell them his headaches?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, when he eventually got a breakthrough, the news had a bold headline that read, “Dell makes $1 million in a single month”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why am I telling you all this?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, because I want to make it very clear to you that, true riches are never quick riches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every great success (including money acquisition) takes time, hard work and pains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing I wish to let you know is that, every of today`s wealthy people have passed through hell (failures, mistakes, rejection etc.) before they eventually became rich… though the public may not be aware of their secret pains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mike Adenuga was a taxi driver and a security guard. Nobody knew about him then. Now when he has become one of the richest men in Africa, some people will (out of their ignorance) assume that he made his money fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a way to make money very fast? Can you actually become rich quickly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can become rich faster than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because there are many ways to money acquisition. Some ways are faster than others. With some ways, you can travel with a motorcycle, while some ways will only be as fast as riding a bicycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual way we were trained to follow is the way of a good job. The problem with this way is that, it’s too slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many millionaires do you know who are employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "How many people on the list of the richest men in Africa are employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are 99.9% of employees not rich?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it’s too slow to make enough money as an employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider the other side of the game… having your own business. While being a successful business owner could be intimidating, it is also rewarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask me. “Which business can I do to make money fast?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with that question is that, no business gives you money fast. Some people, especially online scammers, may promise you that if you can give them a certain amount of money, they will teach you how to make money (especially online) very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "With my experience in this game of business and money, I am yet to see anyone who makes money fast… except what you mean by fast is, after stress, pains, mistakes and failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please don’t be intimidated.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can become rich… I believe you can become rich. But I don’t want to deceive you that you can become rich by doing nothing or just next week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, I will like to show you how to truly get rich. Think of how you can make life better for others and commercialize your offering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody ever becomes rich in life by searching for money… except in an illegal way of course. To make legitimate money, your starting point is to identify how you can make the world a better place with a unique or better product/service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there some products you can produce better than people who are producing them now? Are there some services you could render now better than people who are rendering them now?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, money is nearer to you than you might think.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the business idea that brings money, that’s why Robert Kiyosaki said, “Money is in idea”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The short cut to making quick money is not in searching for some odd, illegal ways to be rich (that’s not the true wealth). The true way to wealth is to discover business opportunities and ideas and take advantage of them before others could.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing I have to tell you before I drop my pen (am I actually using a pen?) is that, making money is more a game of knowledge than most people know.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want our children to become lawyers, we will send them to schools for 20 years or more. When we want our children to become accountants or medical doctors, we will send them to schools for many years.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we want to become business men and women, we simply think of selling anything and making money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t you see how we are wrong here?\n",
    "\n",
    "But why is this so?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because many people in our today’s world see school as a god and since this god is always worshipped, everybody does whatever she teaches… and whatever she doesn’t teach, nobody dares to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since school doesn’t teach us how to be successful in business or how to be rich, most people simply think there is no need to learn anything about making money.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are wrong!\n",
    "\n",
    "To be rich quickly, you have to be a student of wealth creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brain Sher said, “The shortest cut to riches is financial education”. In other worlds, to be rich fast, acquire financial education.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter what you think is stopping you from making money now, knowledge will liberate you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as I conclude this article, I would like to remind you that we only have 2 days remaining before we start our Government Bonds & Tenders Training.\n",

    "08/05/2022, 3:07 pm - +254 701 711058: *HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF STARTING A LIQUID DETERGENT BUSINESS?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every home and business needs detergents for cleaning. The demand for cleaning detergents has been steadily rising as more households and businesses come up.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is good news for aspiring entrepreneurs because it is possible to make these detergents and take advantage of this demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquid detergent as the name implies, is simply soap in liquid form. Home made liquid detergents have become popular and increased competition in the soap industry which was traditionally dominated by bar soap and other factory manufactured detergents.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason being that liquid detergents are more versatile and multi-purpose. They can be used for various tasks such as washing dishes, clothes, floors, windows, cars and almost all other uses. This has made them very popular in homes and businesses such as hotels and restaurants, offices, car wash yards and even schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are also very easy to make. You can make liquid detergents and sell to schools, homes, hotels, car wash yards and other businesses that clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making liquid detergent is very simple and requires very few items. With a little training and experience, almost anybody can make these detergents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, soap is made by combining fats and oils with a chemical (Sodium Hydroxide, also known as ‘Caustic Soda’). Caustic Soda is a white solid substance that easily dissolves in water. It is available on the open market where it is often sold as pellets, granules or flakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the effect you want to achieve, you could include interesting stuff like herbs, honey and other substances that are known to soothe, smooth and heal the skin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the ingredients you need to make detergent, there are basic tools that you will need too. They are so basic that they are easily available all over.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need simple items such as bowls and spoons, buckets, wooden ladle and packaging containers for your finished product. With a budget of about Ksh.2,000 you should have these items.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Detergent Ingredients*\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these ingredients have complicated chemical names but we will use their common trade names. The ingredients should cost you about Ksh.1000 – Ksh.2,000 and can be bought from chemical shops all over town, Kariobangi light industries or industrial area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity of the chemicals are bought according to the quantity of detergent you want to make. If you want to make 100 litres, just ask the dealer to give you ingredients for that quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detergent making is a chemical process and may be a danger to your safety. Remember to use hand gloves to protect your skin from coming into contact with the chemicals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mixing Instructions*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pour the Ungerol in the container that you intend to use preferably with a capacity of 50 litres or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add Ufacid, industrial salt and caustic soda and mix with the wooden spoon until the salt is completely dissolved and the mixture is smooth and fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add more water and stir further to make the paste more dilute. Ensure you add water in small quantities to prevent too much foaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add colour and perfume or fragrance and continue stirring to the required thickness. You can use lemon drops as fragrance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once thickened, pour the mixture into a clean container and set aside for about 2 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be slight variations to these instructions depending on the type or quantity of liquid detergent you intend to produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: You can also check out for tutorials on YouTube.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Packaging*\n",
    "\n",
    "When your detergent is ready for the market, you have to make a decision on what packaging quantities and designs you will use depending on your market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plastic containers come in various sizes such as 300ml, 500ml, 1L, 5L, 10L, 20L or more. Most detergent making businesses prefer the 10L or more containers since they are more popular with businesses such as hotels and restaurants, car wash yards, schools, churches and other businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Households mostly buy in smaller quantities of 500ml, 1L and 5L. Empty plastic containers can be bought in shops in town and industrial area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branding the containers with your contact details can be a good idea especially for marketing. Print labels of different sizes and stick to the containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sales and Marketing*\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquid detergent business is very simple to start and start up costs are also very low. The major task is in marketing the products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your marketing plan should involve visiting schools, churches, households, businesses, shops and offices around you to tell them about your products.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good strategy is to make small samples and distribute to potential clients for free with your contact as you tell them about your products.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are likely to face stiff competition therefore, put a lot of effort in marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packaged liquid detergents have the following average market prices;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ksh.25 – Sh.40 (500ml)\n",
    "2. Sh.250 – Sh.300 (5L)\n",
    "3. Sh.450 – Sh.500 (10L)\n",
    "4. Sh.1,000 (20L)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bear in mind that these figures are estimates from several dealers and may vary depending on location, who is selling and who is buying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use popular flavors such as lavender, lemon and mixed fruit to sell more. Quality should also be upheld by making properly concentrated detergent to attract and retain customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many liquid detergent sellers make profits of about Sh.1,000 – Sh.5,000 per day and make products 3 to 4 times per week but get more orders at the end of the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a day most make and sell between 20L to 30L of detergent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of liquid making is tedious and requires patience and passion. Make sure you have gathered enough information before you set up your liquid detergent business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "We all need soap. Whether in the rural areas, towns, prisons, schools, hospitals – every person needs some soap in one way or another. \n",
    "\n",
    "So you can try out this idea and see how far it will take you and even venture into the manufacturer of flavoured soap, bathing soap and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can start small today and aim for the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our Government Bonds & Tenders Training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We only have 2 days remaining to start our Government Bonds & Tenders Training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called *GOVERNMENT BONDS & TENDERS TRAINING* \n",
    "\n",
    "In this group we are going to train and teach you for 20 days on how to make money doing business with the government by Investing in Government Bonds and Government Tenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing business with the government or making the government your client could mean lots of advantages to your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most crucial is the assurance that your customer will never go bankrupt or even become insolvent. \n",
    "\n",
    "And while you might want to argue that getting a tender when you are a “small person” who lucks connections is similar to going out on a futile fishing mission on the banks of polluted Nairobi River; there are indeed opportunities available for those who are patient enough and willing to learn from experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tenderpreneurship is one of the fastest ways to make money in Kenya – and if growth is what you are looking for, then this is an area worth exploring and this training will be of great help to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our *GOVERNMENT BONDS & TENDERS TRAINING* starts on Wednesday, 11th May 2022.\n",

    "You are a right thinking person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now is the right time to start that business.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Understand what business is.*\n",

    "I know you will feel insulted if I ask you, “do you know what business is?” All of us assume that we know, yet most people don`t know what business is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people see business as a place to make money. That is half-true. Some see business as a venture where we sell products and services. That`s as well not completely true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business is a venture through which we solve people’s problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can see business as a venture by which you will provide products or services to help people make their lives better, you`re already on your way to succeed in the business world.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not starting your business to make money, though you will make money. You are starting your business so that you can help people make their lives easier or better.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Be willing to acquire business skills.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me tell you what most business writers won`t tell you… business is a profession… a profession that requires skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you are thinking of business, compare it with Medicine, Law or Accounting. Whenever you are thinking of becoming a business owner (even a small business owner), think about becoming a lawyer or a medical doctor.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are planning to become a medical doctor, what will you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will acquire medical skills.\n",

    "Just as a pilot, a chemist or an engineer has to be trained to succeed in his field, everyone who intends to make money in business must be trained in the art and science of doing business.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you are planning to start your business, the best way to succeed faster is to start educating yourself about how to run a business and how to make a business successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to become a student of business by reading good business books, magazines and online articles about different skills you need to make your business a success.\n",
    "\n",

    "Six months down the line, you meet a number of them in the street, dejected, resigned and embarrassed to speak out their cases, but we understand them anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of them have sent over 1,000 applications to companies and no one has been sympathetic enough to give them even an internship.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the moment a graduate starts becoming innovative.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find yourself in such a situation, you better stop thinking about employment and figure out a suitable business to start so that you can scare away some common conditions like depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you succeed to secure employment when you still own some business venture, well and good but don’t allow yourself to be a slave of your academic papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The people you see around driving big cars, living large and spending like nobody’s business are all entrepreneurs; unfortunately, most of them never went to school.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is this thing we call pride, very common among graduates. They have set standards and class that can’t allow them to perform some roles within society. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is what is killing Kenya, pride has denied many Kenyans opportunities to be innovative and contribute positively to the society.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most profitable small businesses is selling women shoes and clothes. The world we are living now is totally different from the previous decade, women no longer depend on men to buy them clothes, cosmetics and even take them to salon, they have money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Women are known to be big spenders, and as more and more join the corporate world, they must dress decently and most obviously look trendy.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a graduate, this is one opportunity you should not let pass you, grab it. Eastleigh isn`t far, start by investing Ksh.10,000 on your first stock of shoes and clothes, then advertise your products on social media and also tell your neighbors about your new venture.\n",

    "You will be surprised over time that white collar jobs were meant to make people ignorant of their surroundings.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was with a friend in the university and immediately she completed, she started selling t-shirts and women handbags.\n",

    "09/05/2022, 10:24 am - +254 754 839228: *CAR WASH BUSINESS IN KENYA STEP BY STEP GUIDE*\n",
    "\n",
    "Car wash services in Kenya are increasing in demand. Many people are venturing into the car wash business for livelihood. Vehicles have become affordable and many people are buying them. This has created an opportunity for car cleaning businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know that over 7,500 new vehicles are introduced on Kenyan roads every month? Data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows that a total of 120,664 new cars were bought in Kenya in 2019 alone!\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you don’t need to be a statistician to see just how fast the number of local car owners is growing – it’s obvious, everyone is driving nowadays and therein lies a potential business idea that you might want to invest in (the car wash business).\n",
    "\n",
    "As many people in Kenya are venturing into entrepreneurship, the one business that has caught the attention of young people is the car wash business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Walk or drive into any of the estates in Nairobi or in major roads and highways, you will not miss seeing a car wash within a 1km radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right from the low-income areas of the city to the opulent suburbs, car wash businesses of different magnitudes have thrived into existence to meet the needs of the high number of vehicles being imported into the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "What could be the contributing factor towards the success of a car wash business? Is it a viable business that any aspiring entrepreneur can consider or is the field already crowded?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at 3 reasons why this business is thriving:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Low Startup Costs*\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, setting up a car wash business is not an expensive undertaking. We have different sizes or car wash setups from the heavy machinery reliance ones where a car drives through an automatic rollover washing machine to the basic ones that use small and portable car wash machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if you want to start small and upgrade gradually, then choosing to start at a small-scale level is the best option. And this is partially what has contributed to the success of this business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major costs of starting will include a pressure washing machine, vacuum cleaner, water tanks, buckets, brushes, detergents and access to water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you have your own land, you will have to pay for monthly land rates to the county government if it is public land or the private landowner. Additional costs will include licenses and permits which normally do not cost much, and thereafter hire a team of at least 3 people. The average startup costs for a basic car wash is around Ksh.50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Booming Road Transport Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kenya public transport system is largely dominated by road transport. Kenya road sub-sector accounts for over 80% of the country’s total passenger traffic and 76% of the freight. The road transport is dominated by buses, minibuses, and Lorries which are involved in the transportation of luggage and passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), over 213,715.0 vehicles were registered in 2019 while the number of Public Service Vehicle (PSV) licenses issued increasing by 9.3 per cent from 30,506 in 2018 to 33,349 in 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most if not all of these vehicles visit the car wash by the close of business on a daily basis. An average price that a car wash will charge will range from as low as Kshs.200 for a saloon car to Ksh.500 and above for a bus or a lorry for vehicle body wash.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high volume of vehicles provides a ready market for a car wash business to thrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of a car wash is important to its success. And most of the car wash businesses are set up in high traffic areas. These areas include residential areas, shopping centers, garages, entertainment areas like bars and restaurants, car bazaars, malls and other places car owners and drivers mostly frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then most people would leave their cars to be washed as they indulge in shopping and other social activities. In some cases, you will find up to 5 car wash businesses bordering each other side by side as they fulfil the high demands. Therefore location remains one of the major contributing factors to the success of the car wash businesses in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Analyze The Car Wash Business Idea*\n",
    "\n",
    "This should always be the very first step when thinking of starting a business. Look objectively at your idea and determine how lucrative it is. This is how you do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Potential Market Size\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to ask yourself if there is market for your carwash business and if yes, how big it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Competitive Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes you a worthy competitor in the market? Do you have more experience than other players in the industry? In other words you want to figure out what makes you unique in a potentially crowded market place. Also, find out if anyone else has tried your idea (in the area you want to set up your car wash), and if they failed – why?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assess Capital Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for you, I usually give a rough breakdown and capital estimate for each idea. But besides that, you need to do your own research to get the real picture. Keep a small notebook where you can note all the specific cost outline down.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Do A Deeper Analysis of the Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are satisfied that your idea is a good one, it’s time to take a closer look at the market. Your goal at this stage is to determine what exactly the market needs and how they want it done.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the Differentiating Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "A differentiating factor is simply that one thing that makes you attractive to customers. Ask yourself, why will customers want to get my car washing services instead of my competitors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it because I can deliver faster than others or is it because I have better pricing methodology? What gap have your competitors left so that you can fill?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you add a differentiating factor to your services, you will have an easier time penetrating the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Market Barriers Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A market barrier is something that prevents you from entering a certain field of business at any one time. For instance, there is a barrier to starting a chemist shop since you have to get the approval of the Pharmacy and Poisons Boards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look within your area and do inquiries and see if there are any barriers that bar you from entering into Car wash business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, most car wash businesses don`t have barriers of entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What Makes Your Competitors Successful?\n",
    "\n",
    "In every business there are competitors and learning what makes them successful is the surest way to get an inside scoop of the market conditions of your idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "So once again, keep a closer eye on your potential competitors so that you can fine-tune your game-plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Do a Financial Feasibility Analysis*\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, given that you’ve done idea analysis and a bit of market survey, I assume you have sufficient information on the nitty-gritty of running your car wash business.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let me now show you how to do a financial feasibility study.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate The Start-up Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "The start-up cost comprises the cost of setting up the business and the initial working capital (i.e. the money you put into the business). Determine if your savings will be sufficient to start the business. If not, then look for a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the entire cost of starting up should be made up of:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Cost of setting up the working area\n",
    "\n",
    "-Cost of buying new equipment\n",
    "\n",
    "-Cost of acquiring licenses and certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "The working capital comprises of:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Cost of buying raw materials (e.g. washing soap, washing towels, brushes e.tc)\n",
    "\n",
    "-Cost of initial promotion of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "-If you are going to hire any workers or staff, you might incur some amount to train them\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Viable Is My Business Idea?*\n",
    "\n",
    "An idea is only viable if and only if\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) There is market for it\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) You have figured out how to finance it either through your savings or loan\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) You have a differentiating factor that sets you ahead of the competition\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) You are passionate about it\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) You are ready to be patient with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you invest your money in any business idea, it is always wise to do a feasibility study. Sometimes this small measure of security can help you save a lot of cash that would otherwise be wasted chasing the wind – like most people do!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Plan your Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you venture into car wash business in Kenya, you need to sit back and do proper planning; make sure you have an idea of all the costs involved. Business planning is a very important part of every business venture and that is why you hear about it very often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, most people who think about starting a business usually don’t consider writing a business plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have read from different business experts about the fact that most start-up entrepreneurs do not write a business plan but what I have not read from anyone is why this is so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it that most people have fear (so to say) about writing a business plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think I know the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, there are many myths and lies you probably have heard about the subject of a business plan. Some people present a business plan as if it was a university thesis or an academic report to be defended before certain professors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other people think that a business plan has to be 50 pages long and that it must be written in a certain “approved” format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I am here to tell you that all those opinions are not valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the ugly lies around this important business step, most people are “afraid” of doing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Journey with me as I will reveal the real truth about business plan and at the end, you will discover that it is actually easy to write a business plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Seven Things That Your Business Plan Should Contain.*\n",
    "\n",
    "I will not write any complex term or academic jargon here (because I believe the world is not complex)\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Your business name/title.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is obvious. Example… Sparkle Car Wash Business Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Objective/summary.*\n",
    "\n",
    "They call this Executive Summary, but don’t be deceived by this name. It simply means, why you are writing this plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you want to achieve with your plan? If you’re giving it to an investor, what do you want from him?\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructively state your objective here. If you are giving your plan to someone you want to convince to partner with you, state your objective and if your intention is to get him to finance your business venture, state that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Business description.*\n",
    "\n",
    "What and what is your car wash business all about? What are the future possibilities and threats in your business?\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe your intending business here.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Market strategy.*\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, I expect you to be familiar with your car wash services and market, as close as you are to your wife/husband.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you intend to win a good market share for your business? This is very important, even if you are not presenting your plan to any investor.\n",
    "\n",
    "I advise you to conduct a market analysis. What that simply means is that you should spend time to research and understand your market, then position yourself with the tactics to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Competitors` analysis.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you understand the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors? That’s what this part of the business plan is all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people come up with a formula they call SWORT analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "It simply means that you should analyze the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunity, Reward and the Threats in the market place.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will help you to know how to play your business game and if you will be presenting your business plan to an investor, this will encourage him that you actually understand your “enemies” and you are able to kill them.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Your people.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If I want to invest with you, won’t I have interest in knowing who and who will be part of your business team? That is what you will want to write here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who will be doing what, who will be handle what and who will be employed later to take care of what? These are the answers you have to provide here.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Financial situations and forecasts.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will want to write about the financial requirements of your car wash business, amount on ground now and what and what is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There you have it. A guide that can help you to write a good car wash business plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Choose a Business Name for Your Car Wash*\n",
    "\n",
    "It goes without saying that any successful business must have a name; otherwise, how will your customers identify your services?\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a unique name for your business goes a long way in ensuring that you stand out from both direct competitors and other businesses in your locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people struggle when it comes to choosing a name for their businesses, well that’s a whole different story but for starters, choose a name that is easy to spell, pronounce, and memorize. Make sure that the name conveys some positive meaning about your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also come up with a list of names and ask your friends or other business associates what they think about them. This way, you can scale down to one or two names that most of your respondents find catchy. From there, you can choose the one that makes you happy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a catchy and unique business name for your car wash. It is easy for customers to identify a business by its name. Besides, it is easy for customers to recommend your car wash to their friends by its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Find a Strategic Business Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "Land identification is vital for your car wash business because it aids in determining the flow of customers. There is no way your enterprise will flourish in an area with poor living standards and low traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of your carwash is a huge factor in determining how your business will turn out. First, find a place with high traffic volume and where there is little or no competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, however, the demand is still high even when similar businesses are available in the same location. Such was the case when Hillary Gathambi who started his ‘Sparkle Carwash’ business three months ago at Imara Daima in Nairobi.\n",
    "\n",
    "I asked him why he chose a location that had many carwash businesses to open his own.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s simple,” he said. “Over the years, this place has become popular for having carwashes. So when I spotted an unoccupied space suitable for the business, I had no doubt that it would work. There are a lot of customers for everyone here,” he told me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, find a location with retail or shopping centers nearby, you can be sure that some motorists stopping by will spot your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparkle Carwash is located within a residential area where most working people have their cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sometimes we pick their cars from the estate and return them after we have finished washing them,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "An extra tip is to check the speed limit of the particular area you want to open your carwash, an average speed limit of 30 Km/h will tell you that drivers are not too much in a hurry to make stops while passing by.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best area to purchase or lease land for your car wash business would be close to a residential area or a famous getaway location. A car wash next to a nyama choma restaurant or bar and grill is a cash cow for the diligent Kenyan.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have all the time in the world to wash the cars while the owners take a pint or enjoy some food. Ensure that the car wash location is easily accessible and has all the exposure you can provide. Not to mention, the terrain should be away from areas with physical obstructions such as electric poles, ditches, or too many trees should be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other suitable areas to buy or lease land for a car wash business in Kenya include shopping malls, public facilities, and churches to mention a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "While scouting for locations, ensure the area you pick has a steady water supply. Water coming from a natural source is a bonus since it can never run out. You can also dig a borehole or a well but ensure you treat it regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you set aside an area for tanks, which should always be filled with water when your business takes off.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing most people forget when they are on the ‘seller’ end of any business is that customers are attracted to decency as much as they are engrossed in efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not advisable to start a car wash without rehabilitating the land through removing barriers or fencing the area. For instance, if the land has bushes, you can clear the site and even fence it. Digging trenches and leveling up the ground are also essential processes when renovating the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the money is enough, consider covering the ground with concrete. It helps maintain the ground level while adding to your car wash’s beauty. After this is done, you can create some anticipation by placing a ‘car wash coming soon’ banner at the entrance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If possible add some security features to your yard to ensure safety for the customer’s vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people know that corruption has taken down a lot of bright ideas than anything else in this country. There have been endless court hearings regarding land that has been dragged for ages dwindling progress in the intended business.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, if the area in which you wish to set up a car wash has some land issues, don’t waste your time buying or leasing the land. It makes no sense to prepare for everything then get disappointed later when the business has taken off.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get the Necessary Licenses and Permits*\n",
    "\n",
    "If land ownership or leasing is verified, you can now proceed to this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business licenses and permits are necessary for running a legal business. Entrepreneurs wishing to start a car wash business will need a single business permit issued by the county government which costs between Ksh.5,000 to Ksh.15,000 depending on your county and car wash size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The costs for business permits varies from one county to another. For example, it is expensive to obtain a business permit in Mombasa and Nairobi than in smaller towns like Muranga and Nyamira.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need clearance from the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) if you intend to start a big car wash.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Acquire the Necessary Equipment*\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of your car wash business in Kenya hugely relies on the type of equipment you purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technology has introduced innovations that make washing a car seem natural while reducing the amount of labour and improving the quality of the wash.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equipment to purchase will depend on the services you will offer in your car wash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting a business, take time to consult other entrepreneurs, especially those running businesses that are similar or related to what you want to start. This will help you to avoid mistakes that beginners commonly make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the right equipment for your carwash will be easier if you talk to other carwash owners. For instance, when choosing a pressure washer, consider its amount of PSI (pound per square inch).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, car washing is made quick and easy using pressures ranging from 1200 to 2100 PSI. Depending on your business plan, decide on how many washers you are going to need. Also, determine whether you are going to use an electric machine or one that is powered by petrol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hillary Gathambi (who I told you earlier about) has both machines for his carwash business. “I mostly use the electric one because it is cheaper to operate, but the petroleum one really comes in handy during outages,” he tells me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common services provided in a car wash include upholstery, body washing, engine wash, under wash, dusting, carpet cleaning, interior cleaning, buffing, and waxing. You will need car wash detergents for cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start pressure washing business, you need the following items.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Car Wash Machine*\n",
    "\n",
    "For any serious investor, the first thing you should purchase for this business is a pressure washing machine. These machines come in different capacities, from different brands, and can be new or used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purchasing one should be determined by the estimated number of cars that will frequent your car wash on a daily basis. Your best bet is a durable machine; the extra coin might hurt the budget, but it guarantees longevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you are on a budget, a low capacity model will do before your car wash business brings in enough money for an upgrade. The fuel type used by the pressure washing machine is also a significant factor to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenyans are just about fed up with power outages, which not only irritate the locals but also halts some businesses. If the area you intend to set up your car wash has a history of regular power outages, consider buying petrol or diesel-powered pressure washing machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the petrol one is better considering it guarantees superior performance. As far as the model is concerned, all you need to look at are the features that come with every brand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the features to look out for include a spray gun, pressure options, anti-twist systems, weight, and dust blasting to mention a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more the features, the higher your chances are of improving service delivery on your car wash business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Washing pressure machines are available in leading supermarkets across the country with popular brands such as Karcher and Honda dominating the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Vacuum Cleaners*\n",
    "\n",
    "Purchasing a vacuum cleaner for a car wash business is different from when you’re buying the same equipment for your house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Request to be directed to the area with commercial vacuum cleaners. These vacuum cleaners have more features and are not made for limited usage like their counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purchase commercial vacuum cleaners from specialized dealers. Select a durable vacuum cleaner that can serve many customers in a day without breaking down.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Water Tank*\n",
    "\n",
    "Water tanks are essential in any car wash business. You can purchase a water tank with a capacity ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 liters. Ensure that your tanks are filled with water at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bigger the tank, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Car Washing Detergent*\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the detergents, make sure you don’t make your purchase at the local shop or supermarket. There are specialized detergents meant for washing vehicles, and they can be found in some local stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are perfumed and can enable your car wash to stand out from the competition. However, some people are allergic to strong smells so be sure to ask your customers which ones they prefer for their cars and have a variety of options such as mild or strong-smelling for said detergents.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Brushes, Squeezers, Towels, and Buckets*\n",
    "\n",
    "Brushes, squeezers, towels, and buckets all come in different sizes. You can choose any size and quantity depending on your budget and the number of customers you intend to serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need a source of water; this can be piped or acquired from a natural source and stored in a 1000+ litres water storage tank.\n",
    "\n",
    "While purchasing the equipment above, be sure also to consider some of the services you’re going to offer at your car wash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most common services include body washing, upholstery, interior cleaning, under wash, waxing, dusting, buffing, carpet cleaning, and engine wash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these services might require equipment that is only found in high-end car wash businesses, but you need them to ensure a steady flow of clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "For really small starters, you can start with a few buckets and cotton hand towels and buy the sophisticated machines later as your business expands.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What’s the cost of starting a car wash business in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The car wash business cost in Kenya is highly dependent on your preferences. A lot of the pioneers in the industry started off with little capital yet went on to make a fortune. The car wash business is a profitable small-scale or large-scale idea depending on your vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have the required capital or find luck in your friends, family, savings, or bank and get some financial backing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choices are also there to be made regarding the mobility of your business or the acquisition of a piece of land. Regardless of the decision you make, ensure that you have all the right equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest (Approx.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yard rent: Ksh.5,000 to Ksh.20,000 depending on the county your carwash will be located\n",
    "\n",
    "Rehabilitation: Ksh.10,000 and above depending on cost of raw materials and size of your car wash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Licenses: Ksh.5,000 and above depending on your county and size of carwash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equipment: Ksh.50,000 and above depending on the size of your car wash and services offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing: Ksh.5,000 and above depending on your marketing strategies and marketing budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total: Could be as low as Ksh.50,000 (if you own the land or if you locate your car wash in a rural setup) to Ksh.100,000 and above (for urban areas).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other expenses might also arise as you operate your car wash business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom line, be ready to negotiate your way throughout the process of acquiring land and equipment to ensure you get the best deal and save some money.\n",
    "\n",
    "The car wash business in Kenya is without a doubt one of the easiest ways to become a millionaire today.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Market Your Car Wash Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Having an excellent marketing strategy for your business is one vital step to success. After setting up your business, you don’t sit to wait for customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers don’t know what they don’t know, so don’t just expect them to line up without any effort on your part. Make sure to let the community know about your car wash ahead of the grand opening with onsite advertising (`car wash coming up soon`) sign as well as distributing brochures, setting up posters in public places, and even by word of mouth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another simple way to get customers is by offering quality services, giving discounts to customers, and offering free services once in a while. This is a sure way to getting many customer referrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go for what is convenient for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encourage Current Customers to Make Referrals to Family and Friends. It’s well known in the marketing industry that the most effective type of advertising is the word-of-mouth variety. The rationale for this is quite simple. People tend to place more faith in reviews that come from those they know and trust — rather than from businesses looking to sell their products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "So take advantage of this by encouraging your faithful clients to refer your car wash services to their family, fellow church members, friends, co-workers, and associates. Make it worth their while by offering incentives for their referrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get Social. When it comes to engaging with customers and would-be clients, social media is your friend. Your target market is on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media platforms — and so should you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to set up a presence on various social media sites, and use these accounts to engage with customers and would-be customers. Give them a reason to follow you and to check in from time to time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create Attractive Space. One way you can separate yourself from the pack is to create an environment that is simply different from other car wash operations in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it’s the décor, the magazines in the waiting area, the coffee or light snacks available while they wait, or even free Wi-Fi access, there are things you can do to set your car wash business apart from the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Car Wash Business Success Story*\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the businesses that you can do without incurring losses is car wash business. You only need Ksh.50,000 to Ksh.250,000 to start a car wash anywhere in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two years ago, my cousin told me he had Ksh.80,000 but wasn’t sure what he could do with the money to start generating an income.\n",
    "\n",
    "I fronted the idea of car wash business. This is what he told me, “Hii biashara ikianguka utanilipa hii pesa”.\n",
    "\n",
    "I told him, “Nitakulipa double”.\n",
    "\n",
    "I proposed for him Kericho and for sure he set the business up. It’s now two years na kijana ananipigia asante kila siku.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also sometimes ago, I met with Victor, who owns 5 car wash businesses in Nairobi. He shared with me his success story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is his story on how he started.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was in 2001 when, straight from high school, I came to Nairobi for my college studies. I lived at my cousin’s house in Huruma.\n",
    "\n",
    "At that time, I was very young, shy and naive. I didn’t know Nairobi, not even fending for myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "I stayed at my cousin’s house for six months, and in those six months I managed to find a college, Technical University of Kenya (formerly Kenya Polytechnic University).\n",
    "\n",
    "I was admitted for a course in Electrical and electronics engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "After starting attending school, I would struggle to make ends meet due to financial constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "My cousin worked for construction companies (mjengo) and didn’t have enough money to pay for my matatu transport and pocket money. I had to look for a source of income.\n",
    "\n",
    "My cousin introduced me to his friends, who ushered me into the world of hustling in Nairobi. I could wake up earlier in the morning, go to a construction site, beg for work and at the end of the day I could walk home with Ksh.250, which was good at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did the construction site jobs for around 1 year while schooling until another friend, who had opened a car wash in Donholm told me to work for him.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where I learn’t that there is money in car wash business. Unlike in construction jobs where I was getting Ksh.250 per day, here I was getting at least Ksh.700 per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "I could see my friend pocket Ksh.3,000. I was so motivated that I told myself, “this should be me”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving after saving, one year later I had Ksh.50,000. That’s the money I used to start my own car wash in 2004 in Umoja Nairobi. At that time, the washing machines and water was easy to obtain, competition was also not stiff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most business where you have to wait for a while before the first customer comes, my business got the first customer 1 hour after opening it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I remember it was a Toyota Prado that was driven into my car wash and after 20 minutes, I was Ksh.300 richer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s now years and am still growing strong in business. I have managed to make a total of over Ksh.20 million from my first car wash business.\n",
    "\n",
    "And about my college education, I deferred for a while but I completed in 2012, but I haven’t used it anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I can say is that car wash business is lucrative in Nairobi. There are so many vehicles in Nairobi. If you manage to set it up near a busy shopping centre, you will not go home with less than Ksh.4,000 per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I have also learn’t is that customers want excellent services. What’s important here is how your customer feels after your service. He comes in as a patient and once his car is treated well, he will come again.\n",
    "\n",
    "My business has grown and I now have 4 other branches, 2 branches along Ngong Road and the other 2 branches along Thika road.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Just How Profitable Is A Car Wash?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Kenyan dreams of owning a car at some point in life. Regardless, there is a section of the 51 Million Kenyans that has actualized those dreams. And as statistics go, over 90,000 vehicles hit the Kenyan roads every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does that reality tell you?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of car-related businesses that are out there waiting to be exploited. One such business is the car wash business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know that the Car Wash business is actually one of the most profitable businesses in Kenya at the moment?\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have seen so many Car Wash businesses mushrooming around where there used to be none.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is to say that as profitable as it is if you don’t jump on this opportunity today you may never get a space to set up your car wash.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average a small car wash business that has just started can handle 15 cars per day (weekends are peak days). The average price of cleaning a car is Ksh.200.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition you can offer services like carpet cleaning, night parking and restaurant to bolster your margins. Overall, a well run car wash business in Kenya can rake in Ksh.130,000 per month with a net profit margin of 40%.\n",
    "\n",
    "A car wash business is profitable if you have a good business location. The normal price of washing a car is usually Ksh.200. Buses and Lorries, charges are Ksh.500 and above. Therefore, you can make up to Ksh.5,000 in a day from a car wash if you have many customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Charges from a standard Car wash in Nakuru Town*\n",
    "\n",
    "(This charges may be higher depending on the location of the business and costs incurred)\n",

    "Car wash business is a safe bet especially for anyone who is in employment (or another business field) looking to explore a new arena. Its risk potential is quite low and there is massive potential for it to grow given the fast rising number of car ownership in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, just as with any other business it requires a great deal of patience, strategy and timely judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any other business, a car wash business needs professionalism and offer customers quality services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through hard work and persistence, you can grow your car wash business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Success Factors of Car Wash Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Location- A good location will attract more customers and therefore higher revenues. A good location should be near a busy road, supermarket, residential areas and other areas mostly flocked by car owners and drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car wash Management- The staff should be friendly, outgoing and organized. A well-managed car wash business will result in increased revenues, happy clients and satisfied staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Service- Exceptional car wash service will attract new clients, retain current clients and serve as a marketing tool for the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variety service- Where the business offers extra services beyond the normal body wash, the clients are likely to spend more and thus higher revenues. These extra services may include upholstery, engine wash, waxing, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Just start!*\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing is you have to start from somewhere. Sometimes, you don’t have to have everything figured out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car washing is not a skill you acquire from going to school; anyone can do this job if they are willing to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You must be keen to details,” Hillary tells me. He started the business with his small home tank for water storage purposes; now, he has managed to buy extra ones for the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we concluded our brief conversation, he informed me of plans to construct a shed after most clients expressed the desire to wait as they had their cars washed. Still, a long way to go for him!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are busy with other businesses or employment, you can install CCTV at your car wash and monitor your business from anywhere you are. Same applies to those who are planning to open more than one car wash.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can get a good place, it will give you value for your money. Also, focus on customer satisfaction and continually improve your services.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Read this short story of Pablo and Bruno and decide which side you belong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once upon a time, long, long ago, two ambitious cousins Pablo and Bruno were neighbours in a small village in Italy. The young men were best of friends and big dreamers.\n",
    "\n",
    "They would talk endlessly about how someday, they would become the richest men in the village. Both were bright and extremely hardworking. \n",
    "\n",
    "All they yearned for was an opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then one day an opportunity showed up. The village decided to hire two men to carry water from a nearby well to the town square. The job went to Pablo and Bruno.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each man grabbed two buckets and rushed to the well. By the end of the day, they had filled the cistern in the town square to its capacity. The village treasurer paid them their salary… 2 pennies for each bucket of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This is our dream come true!” shouted Bruno. “I can’t believe how lucky we have become.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But Pablo wasn’t so sure. His back ached and he was extremely tired from carrying the heavy buckets. He did not like the idea of getting up and going to work the next morning. He decided to look for a better way to get the water to the town square from the well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next morning before they could pick their buckets and head to work Pablo said, “Bruno, I have a plan”.\n",
    " \n",
    "“Instead of carrying buckets back and forth for a few pennies per day, let’s build a pipeline from the well to the town square.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Bruno stopped dead in his tracks: “A pipeline? Who has ever done such a crazy thing?” Bruno shouted. “We have a great job ahead of us. I can carry 100 buckets a day and I make a dollar. I’m rich and satisfied. By the end of the week, I can buy a new pair of shoes. By the end of the month a cow. By the end of six months I will buy a new hut. Can’t you see we have the best job in town? We have weekends off and two weeks paid vacation every year. Our life is perfect. Get out of here with your crazy pipeline idea.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But Pablo was not easily moved. He patiently explained his ideas and plans to his best friend. Pablo decided to work part of the day carrying buckets and part of the day and weekends building his pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, he knew it would be hard work digging a ditch in the rocky soil. Because he was paid by the number of buckets delivered, he knew his income would drop. \n",
    "\n",
    "He always knew that it would take a long time before his pipeline dream would pay off. But Pablo gathered courage and believed in his dream.\n",
    " \n",
    "As time went by, Bruno and the rest of the villagers began mocking Pablo. Bruno was earning twice as much as Pablo, he had bought some shoes and a new hut for himself. \n",
    "\n",
    "He even bought a donkey and outfitted it with a new leather saddle. \n",
    "\n",
    "The villagers called him Mr. Bruno and they cheered when he bought rounds at the local pub.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Bruno took time off on evenings and weekends, Pablo spent his hours out in the cold digging his pipeline. The first 12 months Pablo did not have much to show for his hard work. The job was getting harder and harder because Pablo was working almost twice as much as Bruno.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pablo kept reminding himself that tomorrow’s dreams are built on today’s sacrifices. \n",
    "\n",
    "So day by day he kept digging, inch by inch. Inches turned to feet and then 100 feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Keep your eyes on the prize,” he kept thinking as he drifted off to sleep with the sounds of laughter coming from the village pub where Bruno was buying more and more rounds for his friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then after about 15 months, he realized that his pipeline was half-way finished, which meant he only had to walk half as far to fill his buckets. He used the extra time to work on his pipeline. He even had an hour long break every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bruno on the other hand was hunched in pain, his steps gradually slowed down. He was angry, sullen and suddenly he seemed to realized that he was doomed to carry buckets for the rest of his life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stressed; he began to spend less time at work and more time in the village pub. \n",
    "\n",
    "His friends would giggle when the town drunk mimicked Bruno’s stooped posture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bruno seemed to have run out of jokes and he couldn’t afford to buy more rounds for the villagers as usual. He preferred to sit alone in a dark corner surrounded by empty bottles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally Pablo’s great moment arrived, his pipeline was complete! The villagers crowded around as the water gushed from the pipeline into the town square cistern. Now that the town had adequate supply of water, people from around the area settled into the village and the village prospered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pablo did not have to carry buckets anymore. The water flowed whether he worked or not. It flowed while he slept. It flowed while he played on weekends. The more the water flowed into the village, the more money Pablo made.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, Pablo had bigger plans. So he did not stop there, he even went ahead to build pipelines all over the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you would expect, the pipeline left his old friend Bruno jobless.\n",
    "\n",
    "We all live in a bucket-carrying world. But who are you? Are you a bucket carrier or a pipeline builder?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you get paid only when you work like Bruno? Or do you invest your time and resources wisely and get paid over and over again like Pablo the pipeline builder?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people focus on linear income in the name of salary, allowances and one-off payments. Wise men on the other hand focus on passive income in the name of royalties, interest rates, value addition and profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relying on linear income is similar to using buckets to fetch water from the river. With time, you will get too old and too tired to transport them to and fro and that means you will have to starve for as long as you don’t go to the river.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relying on passive income on the other hand is similar to building a pipeline. It may require a lot of work at the beginning but with time, you will no longer have to go to the river to get water – the river will come to you and you will not starve.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most fundamental principal of wealth creation that most (including you) are oblivious about.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are like most people, you are currently using the bucket-carrying plan. You are busy working hard for someone else who then pays you a small salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the bucket-carrying strategy is that it gets a bit tiring and monotonous with time. And you can easily find yourself jobless anytime – which means the concept of a “secure job” is actually an illusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intelligent, wealthy people are pipeline builders. Make a point of joining them today.\n",
    "\n",

    "10/05/2022, 12:41 pm - +254 754 839228: *WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BEST BUSINESS IDEAS TO START IN NAIROBI?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have traveled and interacted with various entrepreneurs in many towns but I can attest that the ideal town to do business in Kenya is Nairobi. Every business is profitable in this town because of the huge circulation of money. But there are businesses that are more profitable than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the cost of setting up a venture can be intimidating, you are assured of attracting profits each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most businesses in Kenya are profitable but it all depends on where they are located and the management strategies of the owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to our research, some of the best businesses to start in Nairobi include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Day Care*\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a day care in Nairobi won’t cost more than Ksh.100,000 but the profits can envy not only the short sighted but also seasoned entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many day cares in Estates like South B and South C, Kilimani and Rongai charge up to Ksh.7,000 per month per baby. If the daycare has 20 babies, you will generate Ksh.140,000. Assuming that expenses will take the extra Ksh.40,000; you will remain with Ksh.100,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Chemist*\n",
    "\n",
    "I am one of those people who used to despise Chemist operators. Every time I visited a Chemist, I could see almost empty shelves and try to imagine how the owners survive in such a condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was embarrassed when a friend who owns a Chemist along Mombasa Road Nairobi confessed to me that he makes monthly profit close to Ksh.500,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought he was bragging before me, I had to visit other friends who own similar chemists in different towns. From the answers I got, the lowest profit I heard was Ksh.70,000 per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that make them realize huge profits is the fact that prices of drugs are not regulated in Kenya. Actually, chemist operators fix prices based on the customer status and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Car Wash*\n",
    "\n",
    "Car Wash is a lucrative business in Nairobi today. The business employs more than 200,000 Kenyans around the county where 30,000 come from Nairobi and it’s environ.\n",
    "\n",
    "As dirty as it looks, the job is well paying, no doubt. To wash a small car in Nairobi is not less than Ksh.250 while a medium vehicle goes for Ksh.500 and a big truck can go to up to Ksh.5,000. This is a serious business, men!\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the number of cars in Nairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru, do you think if you start a car wash you will lack at least 10 customers a day?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two years ago, my cousin told me he had Ksh.80,000 but wasn`t sure what he could do with the money for him to start generating income. I fronted the idea of car wash. This is what he told me, “hii bizna ikianguka utanilipa hii pesa”. I told him, “nitakulipa double”.\n",
    "\n",
    "I proposed for him Kericho and for sure he set the business up. It’s now two years na kijana ananipigia asante kila siku.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Salon*\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of where you intend to start your salon, the business will not give you headache when you finally decide to start. You need experienced workers, a small room and equipment costing less than Sh.100,000. You can as well start from your house if you don’t have sufficient capital to operate a salon within a hired premise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This business is very profitable and it doesn’t require many restrictions to operate. But one thing you must note is that you have to be extremely cautious. We have noticed that employees are cunning. They make sure they pocket at least half of the money they make in a day, leaving the owner with nothing. \n",
    "\n",
    "What you ought to do is to have CCTV cameras in the room so that you can monitor the flow of customers – this way you can manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Berber shop*\n",
    "\n",
    "Many individuals over look Berber shop business simply because they assume its run by illiterate people. But it’s one business with extraordinary profits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the popular politicians in Kenya operate several executive Berber shops in major towns and cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start a Berber shop you need a chair, a machine which costs less than Ksh.5,000, Methylated spirit, a mirror, a towel and of course skills. All these things will require less than Ksh.20,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if you want to open an executive barbershop, it will cost you Ksh.100,000 and above.\n",
    "\n",
    "What will require some good amount is the room where your business will be operating from.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are educated, jobless and living in Nairobi, try opening a Berber shop instead of staying idle at home; it might be a turning point for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Shoe Shining*\n",
    "\n",
    "A friend of mine who operates shoe shinning business in Nairobi told me he makes between Ksh.2,000 to Ksh.5,000 per day and there is no time business is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "What he did was to choose a suitable location for the business, buy chairs, towels; shoe polish and brush and source of water. He operates the business from Nairobi CBD.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you went through school and you are shying away from operating shoe shining business, you better change your mind set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shoe shining business is easier to start as long as you have Ksh.15,000 to Ksh.30,000 in your pocket for license and equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it can be tricky to own a shoe shining space in Nairobi CBD but what you should do is approach any of the City Council employees and talk to them nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Selling Second Hand Clothes (Mitumba)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Selling Mitumba clothes is the easiest business to start in Kenya as long as you know where to buy your products from. Most traders in Kenya nowadays source their clothes from Eastleigh, Gikomba and Muthurwa Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, you won’t need to break into a bank or blow your budget to start the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start with as low as Ksh.1,000 if you decide to hawk or sell online.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Ksh.1,000, you can go and hand-pick outfits one by one from markets such as Gikomba in Nairobi and Kongowea in Mombasa. To get the good stuff, go very early in the morning or at the time your specific supplier opens a bale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can buy fagia clothes. These are the remnants of a bale after customers pick most of the best outfits. The clothes are sold at throwaway prices to make room for a new bale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sales usually happen on Saturdays, since suppliers want to do away with old stock and open new ones the same day.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your budget is not so tight and you can spare about Ksh.30,000 or less, get a bale. One thing about second-hand clothes is that the more items you buy, the less they cost you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most sought after bales are those of ladies and kidswear. However, you are not limited to these. You can go for shoes, bedsheets, toys, or men’s wear as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "*8. Selling Women Handbags/Clothes*\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank God there is Eastleigh in Nairobi!\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays as long as you have a Facebook page and you are connected, you can easily start this business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most women in Nairobi offices fear going to Eastleigh to purchase cheap quality bags and clothes; those ladies who are informed capitalize on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can buy a bag at Ksh.900 and sell at Ksh.3,000, which is a gold mine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing with this business is that you don’t need a physical location, simply have a Facebook page and an instagram account and get as many friends as possible to introduce you to offices.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can encourage jobless Kenyans to try this business and life can change for the better. It is not beneficial to stay idle at home when you have a degree while those with zero skills are engaging in business which could otherwise be owned by someone like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally;*\n",
    "\n",
    "As I always say, there is no marathon race that has ever been won by those who did not start the race. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you like the ideas discussed above and you have what it takes to actualize them… then don’t wait to start… just do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, tomorrow we shall be starting our training on Government Bonds & Tenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called *GOVERNMENT BONDS & TENDERS TRAINING* \n",
    "\n",
    "In this group we are going to train and teach you for 20 days on how to make money doing business with the government by Investing in Government Bonds and Government Tenders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing business with the government or making the government your client could mean lots of advantages to your business. \n",

    "\n",

    "Suddenly, you realize that your business idea is more fizzle than sizzle. \n",
    "\n",
    "What do you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to succeed*\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are that you are putting too much pressure on yourself – pressure not to make mistakes, pressure to be financially stable, pressure to make your mother proud and pressure to succeed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do whatever you can to step out from the crushing weight of all the pressure you feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on re-building your self-confidence by setting small achievable goals for yourself… and when you reach them, acknowledge and give yourself a pat in the back. \n",

    "Remember; Rome was not built in a day.\n",

    "*2. Don’t lose patience, some businesses require more time to establish*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most businesses tend to stagnate during the first 12 months of starting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you are very lucky, things don’t always take off immediately. The market needs time to familiarize with your business before they embrace it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of giving up and complaining how bad the market conditions are, you should focus on fine-tuning your strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do less of what doesn’t work and more of what works well for your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Don’t bury your head in the sand, face the problem*\n",
    "\n",
    "When the going gets tough, the tough get going. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, in most cases we tend to give up when we are just a few meters away from discovering the gold-mine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than losing focus, the ideal thing to do is to focus more time and attention to your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to identify the cause of your failure and deal with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Could it be that you hired the wrong employees? \n",

    "\n",
    "Are you selling to the wrong market? \n",
    "\n",
    "Some markets are easy to penetrate but they don’t have adequate purchasing power to support your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Case in point is the Kenyan Facebook, Instagram and tiktok arena which is mainly made up of college and high school students who don’t have much purchasing power.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the biggest reasons many of us will never start a business is because we want to first be certain before we take action.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t have all the information and knowledge I need to start a business”\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered why many of the smart people you know are not entrepreneurs? \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s because of a syndrome I call ‘analysis paralysis’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis paralysis is a condition many of us suffer from that makes us want to know everything and have ALL the information about a business before we start. \n",
    "\n",
    "We analyze our business ideas so much that we end up very confused and often too paralyzed or afraid to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over-analyzing a business idea can often lead to paralysis. In the end, you become too afraid to take any action.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good (bad) news is, you will never know everything or have all the information you need before you start a business. Of course, you will have to do your homework; only foolish people walk blindly into a business venture but you won’t gather 100% of the information you \n",
    "need before starting a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why entrepreneurs are known to take ‘calculated’ risks. Calculated risk means that rather than allow the things you do not know to stop you from taking action, you start by working with the things you know. \n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on the half-full part of a glass of water, not the half-empty part. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a business is like driving your car to work. You know where you want to go (your office) but you are not totally sure about the condition of the road that leads to your destination. \n",
    "\n",
    "There may be serious traffic, pot holes or diversions due to ongoing construction work on some parts of the road. \n",
    "\n",
    "There may even be an armed robbery operation going on. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, there is no way you can be absolutely certain beforehand of the nature of your route to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of our poor knowledge, every morning, many of us still get on the road knowing that whatever challenges come up, we will find our way past them. \n",
    "\n",
    "We may need to use alternative routes to beat the traffic, drive carefully to avoid pot holes or call the office to tell the boss you may be arriving late due to a road block.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in our quest to start a business, we behave quite differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of us never get on the road because we want to know exactly how many pot holes and road blocks there are before we start the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you cannot be certain about everything before you start a business, you need to have a plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "A business plan allows you to put your thoughts together and disciplines you to focus on your destination. It helps you to anticipate the road blocks, pot holes and traffic on the road to your destination (business success).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the successful entrepreneurs in Kenya, Africa or around the world didn’t know everything about the businesses they were getting into until they started. \n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of them lost money, others made mistakes. The most striking feature of their success stories is that they learned from their good and bad experiences and used the knowledge to improve and grow \n",

    "\n",
    "Despite cheaper computers and wireless internet modems flooding the market, a sizeable number of customers are still trooping into cyber cafes to do more than just checking emails and surfing the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "And while some analysts have sounded the death knell for small internet kiosks, statistics from the ground show (to the contrary) that the daring ones are actually growing NOT shrinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, if you have been toying with this business idea for some time don’t be tempted to shelve it yet. Here are some useful tips for potential and existing cyber cafe owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Choose a Good Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, go for a place with high foot traffic of mostly young scholars and professionals. Think of an area near an upcoming or existing university or college. Alternatively, go for the high-end market in the CBDs of major towns.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Build the Workstation*\n",
    "\n",
    "A small cafe would require one workstation partitioned to create exclusive booths for up to 4 client computers. In addition, a small management booth with a few display shelves (for snacks, envelopes, flash disks and other merchandise), space for the main computer and space for a printer/photocopier would also be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Book Licenses*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to start a cyber cafe in Kenya, you need 3 mandatory licenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*(1) County Council Single Business Permit*\n",
    "\n",
    "All 47 counties in Kenya require you to pay for this license before you open your business. The cost may vary from county to county with Kajiado averaging at Ksh.5,000 – Ksh.15,000 per year and Nairobi at Ksh.20,000 – Ksh.35,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(2) County Council Outdoor Advertising and Signage Permit*\n",
    "\n",
    "Some county governments (like Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu) require you to pay a permit for outdoor marketing if you’re going to put a sign-board to attract customers to your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(3) Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK) License*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you will be playing music in your cafe, then this license is a must-have. Otherwise, you can desist from playing any kind of music to save on cost (the trade-off being you may not attract many young customers).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4: Assemble Your Equipment*\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, bring your machines. Each computer should have a legitimate Operating System software (if you can’t afford copyrighted Microsoft software go for open source software or Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "Link up with a cost-friendly internet service provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, and did I mention you need a software to track computer usage in order to charge clients accordingly?\n",
    "\n",
    "NOW, you are ready to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Secret to Growing Your Cyber Cafe against All Odds*\n",
    "\n",
    "The secret to succeeding in this business lies in diversification. Gone are the days when customers seeking internet services were the backbone of cyber cafe firms. Consider adding a wide host of services to your cyber in order to attract many walk-in customers. Some examples of these add-on businesses include:\n",
    " \n",
    "*Mobile money agency outlet (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Equity,KCB and Cooperative Bank agencies don’t disappoint).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Video games outlet\n",
    "\n",
    "*Typing and proof-reading services\n",
    "\n",
    "*Instant passport photo taking and printing services\n",
    "\n",
    "*Printing images from clients mobile phones and memory cards\n",
    "\n",
    "*Photocopy services\n",

    "\n",
    "*Graphic design and printing of promotional materials\n",
    "\n",
    "*IT services\n",
    "\n",
    "*Computer training services (particularly in the rural areas)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you can venture into online business. For example you can run your eCommerce store using your cyber cafe as your physical address.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you can start a cyber cafe with much less, a bare minimum budget of Ksh.100,000 is highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "A well run cyber cafe with at least 4 computers and an added service like M-pesa, graphic design, web-design, eCommerce, photocopy services etc can rake in up to Ksh.750,000 per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",

    "So forget about the myth that cyber cafes “don’t make money nowadays”. The secret to succeeding in any business lies in innovation..\n",

    "\n",
    "Being an entrepreneur can be quite frustrating especially when you run a business that barely pays you back. \n",
    "\n",
    "It gets even more frustrating when you are trying to explain to your rural folk why you can’t get a “normal job”.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter what business you are into, entrepreneurship is never a smooth sail. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some main challenges you will encounter being a small business owner and what you need to do to overcome each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1.The struggle of self-doubt and negative thinking*\n",
    "\n",
    "Will people take me seriously when I present my idea to them? \n",
    "\n",
    "Will investors think I am serious when I tell them about my growth plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is my small company fit enough to compete with the big boys for the big contracts?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are worries every entrepreneur faces and so if you are experiencing them, then hey, welcome to the club. \n",
    "\n",
    "We all face attitude and perception issues but we should not let them get in our way to success.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution*\n",
    "\n",
    "Start practicing positive affirmations that is, look at yourself in the mirror every morning and challenge yourself to be the best you can be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a step further and join focus groups. These are groups that bring like-minded entrepreneurs together to discuss various challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more you share with other entrepreneurs, the more you will find that your problems are a tiny fraction of what others are going through… and your self-doubt and negative thinking will eventually diminish.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Being broke but still needing to push forward*\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have these big dreams that your small kibanda will grow into a big mall one day. Or that your small chicken supply shack will blossom into the next KFC or Kenchic.\n",
    "\n",
    "But then you are just another broke Kenyan who struggles to pay rent at the end of the month. Is there light at the end of the tunnel for you? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if you ask me I would say YES, there is light at the end of the tunnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "If only you are a bit more patient you will discover that money (or lack of it) is just but a tiny portion of the recipe that prepares highly successful entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution*\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep hope, your lack of money will eventually come to pass. The only thing you need to be doing right now is to pump in as much “sweat capital” as you can into your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "With time, you are going to accumulate several assets and by assets I mean things like a good name, repeat customers and reliable financiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trust me, this problem is going to disappear before you even notice it, just keep hope.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. People who love your services but are too broke to be your customers*\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, quite often as an entrepreneur you will find yourself in this situation where people only admire what you have to offer but they don’t really give you any sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am told this is quite a common problems especially with online marketing where most commentors are simply admirers rather than serious buyers. \n",
    "\n",
    "And this happens in real life as well… a person will walk into your nice boutique, try out a few clothes but once you mention the price, they slither away without uttering a word.\n",

    "\n",
    "A little over 15 years ago, cameras were not such a big deal.\n",

    "There was one photographer in the whole village who would walk around taking pictures. If you missed him, it could take you a whole month for your next pose.\n",

    "\n",
    "Photographers are hired to cover events like parties and conferences. Pregnancies too are an opportunity for photoshoots.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had a talk with Eustace Maina, a lifestyle photographer and co-founder of Eye Con Photography.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The digital media revolutionised photography. The advent of Facebook was godsent. There were no photographers to meet the high demand. As a matter of fact, only journalists were taking pictures professionally. We came in and found a ready market,” said Maina.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company has expanded and made a name for itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "His capital, he said, was Sh.500,000, which he recouped in less than a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There is money in photography, but you must identify a market you wish to target. We have bought many expensive cameras from upcoming photographers who quit because it did not work out for them,” added Maina.\n",
    "\n",
    "He revealed that they charge Sh.25,000 to cover corporate events and Sh.5,000 for ordinary photoshoots. In a week, they make an average of Sh.30,000.\n",

    "\n",
    "An air of mystery surrounding cryptocurrencies is holding back Kenyans from taking part in ongoing massive wealth distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "15 years since emerging in 2007, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are no longer a passing fad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over $200 billion of value has been created in what is just the beginning of an open alternative financial system. Just like anyone can download an app on a smartphone and connect to the world without asking for permission. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is even more facilitating is the fact that sophisticated financial technologies, like automated crypto trading, are now freely available for every private investor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Kenya today you can buy, trade, exchange, hold and store cryptocurrencies as long as you do not break any existing laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get started with cryptocurrency*\n",
    "\n",
    "For starters, you need to try out paper trading before going deep into the investment. Then you will need what is called a blockchain wallet, an app that lets you store, send, and receive digital assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are dozens of options to choose from: online, on android and apple store for example blockchain, mycelium and coinomi. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you download and install one, the next step is to secure your wallet in case you forget your password or lose your phone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some people who have ignored backups as a safety precaution have fallen prey to sophisticated hacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Add a strong PIN and back up your 12 word phrase to help you recover your bitcoin in the worst of scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your wallet now needs something to put in it, otherwise, what is it good for? \n",
    "\n",
    "So you need to find yourself some bitcoins to add to your wallet. Buying bitcoins in Kenya is not easy, there aren’t many services that cater to Kenyans. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have two options when considering where to buy or sell bitcoin for Kenya shillings.\n",
    "\n",
    "One option is the members of the Blockchain Association of Kenya who broker bitcoin and digital assets locally. Another option is to head over to an online peer-to-peer marketplace where you can exchange regular money for digital assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Localbitcoins.com is a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, investors can find very useful information and guidance on cryptocurrencies on Coinformant.\n",
    "\n",
    "How you choose to settle the transaction is up to you and the broker – cash, bank, mobile money or airtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, brokers will ask you for your bitcoin address – a long hexadecimal string that lets other people deposit bitcoins into your wallet. \n",
    "\n",
    "To receive bitcoins, go to your wallet, click on receive and copy a string that looks like this 1P1jyUGjQpnZ5daExhvccWPcdZ2AVCviTW; this is your bitcoin wallet address.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Blockchain Association of Kenya recommends only transacting with trusted brokers with stellar reputation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud and scams are a big challenge in acquiring, trading or investing in blockchain assets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So now that you have bitcoins in your wallet, what do you even do with them?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Make Online and cross border payments:* Well, you could send them to a friend or family member wherever they are in the world as a gift or remittance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bitcoin works as a payment network, so anyone can instantly make online payments and send or receive money from abroad.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, Anthony Muisyo, a student from the University of Nairobi uses cryptocurrency to place bets on online gambling sites that accept bitcoin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mukiri a car dealer on Ngong Road sends bulk payments to Japan using bitcoin. Since Japan’s parliament passed a law recognizing bitcoin for payments, Japanese car dealers now accept bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Become a digital commodity broker and trader:* Alternatively, you can always settle for becoming a digital asset dealer, broker or agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the comfort of your home or workplace or while roaming, you can trade like insurance brokers, or the exhibition traders of Nairobi or the maize truckers of Eldoret. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptocurrencies are just like commodities – only that they are digital commodities therefore easier to trade. You don’t need a warehouse or physical store, all you need is a smartphone, a reputation and a stream of clients.\n",

    "\n",
    "Of late, Justine and I have been receiving lots of messages from our readers and the following 4 questions seem to dominate the list of inquiries.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I have saved little capital, could you please give me a good business idea that I can invest in with quick returns?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What are some of the business ideas that you would recommend to a person who has no experience as an entrepreneur?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“There are limited opportunities in the Kenyan rural areas, what type of business can I start over there?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I already have a job and I would like to start a part-time business (or side-hustle) so that I can boost my income. Can you help me?”\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does it take to identify the right kind of idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "*6 Clues That Will Give You a Business Idea*\n",
    "\n",
    "*CLUE 1: Look at Which Problems Affect Your Society*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first and easiest way to arrive at a viable business idea. Look at what problems face majority of people in your neighborhood and try to come up with a comprehensive solution and make it a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if people in your area are having to travel for long distances to re-fill their cooking gas cylinders you can pick the idea of starting a shop that supplies gas cylinders.\n",
    "\n",
    "If people are having problems accessing clean water, think of drilling a borehole and start selling them water for a small fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "If people are struggling getting quality education, and you can help, why not start a coaching business?\n",
    "\n",
    "If people are too busy in the office and have no time for lunch, why not start a food supply business?\n",
    "\n",
    "As much as the society will never lack problems you will never lack a business idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CLUE 2: Sell Your Expertise as a Service*\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone of us is an expert in one way or another. For example, while I am good at offering business advice, someone else is quite good at photography. You also have an area of expertise as well – may be you are a good cook or you are an excellent sportsman.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are good at playing the guitar why not think of starting a guitar school and start offering guitar lessons for a fee?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are good at social media why not start building your social media consultancy business today?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are good at offering fashion advice why not start a fashion blog?\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of starting a business at an area you are an expert in is that you can easily beat the competition so long as you offer quality services to your clients. Of course, such a business might be difficult to start but with patience, dedication and quality services; there’s no room for failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CLUE 3: Convert Your Passion or Talent into a Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "We all have our unique passions and talents. You have your talent or special ability that you can transform into a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn’t matter how strange your talent or passion is, provided you have the guts to market it out there you can rest assured of getting a customer or two.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there is this young man who walks around Nairobi carrying a big drum on his shoulders. He calls himself “The One Man Band” because he plays all of his 12 instruments by himself. While that is a somewhat strange talent, he still makes a living from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how different is this man from you? The only difference is that he is bold enough and does not shy off from marketing his talent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stand up right now and market your talent or passion and customers will gradually come to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CLUE 4: Create Your Own Product*\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Mark Zuckenberg (the man behind Facebook) and Bill Gates (the man behind Microsoft) so different from the rest of us? These two men created unique products that changed the world for good.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a product that will change the world for good – and you don’t need to be a scientist to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could start making unique bracelets and jewelries. You can as well write a book and sell it. You can record a good video of yourself and sell it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a good fashion designer, you can create a unique shirt say with Kenyan colors and sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only important thing you need to do to make a breakthrough here is to make sure that your product is helpful, unique, original and of high quality.\n",
    " \n",
    "NOTE: No matter how strange your idea is, somebody out there is yearning to benefit from it and would even pay a premium to consult you for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CLUE 5: Make a Cheaper Version of an Existing Product*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start a company that offers customers an existing product at a lower price. For instance, you can start a cheaper barbershop to compete with pricy ones in your estate. Or you could start offering cheaper courier services from Mombasa to Nairobi.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can bake cakes, you can price your products at a cheaper rate (without compromising on quality) and market aggressively.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about you start a cheaper car wash offering the same quality services as your competitors?\n",
    "\n",
    "People are always looking for ways to save and if you can offer your products even for Ksh.5/= cheaper than your competitors you can easily secure a place for your company in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, while giving products at a cheaper price might be a good idea, the same has to translate to profit for your business. So be careful not to sell your products at a loss all in the name of wooing new customers into your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CLUE 6: Think About The Future*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask yourself, what is next? Think about trends and technologies on the horizon and how you might innovate something that makes the future better.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can think about innovating a solution that will help smartphone owners use their phones for long without worrying about battery life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about creating a mobile phone application that makes it possible to search Google without the internet (oops! I hear somebody has already done that).\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to observe modern trends, then predict the needs of the future and then create a solution for those needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What Lesson Can We Learn From This Long Article?*\n",
    "\n",
    "√ There are many ideas out there and it is upon you to use the right method to identify the right ones for you\n",
    "\n",
    "√ No one will ever give you a magical idea if you don’t go out there to research\n",

    "\n",
    "√Before you create a new product or sell a certain product ask yourself, “Would I need to buy this if I came across it in the market?”\n",

    "\n",
    "Kenya boasts more than 70 oil marketing and importing companies, though most people know ‘the big five’.\n",
    "\n",
    "These companies are Gulf African Petroleum Corporation, Total Kenya, Vivo Energy, Libya Oil Kenya and KenolKobil.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you will agree that it would take quite a bit of courage and a healthy sense of risk to decide to play in this arena as a young businessman.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that’s exactly what Simon Kirima of Awali Group is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Awali Group is an oil marketing company that owns seven independent petrol stations nationwide and three dealerships, and supplies fuel to independent fuel stations, hotels, hospitals and other industrial outfits.\n",
    "\n",
    "I met with Simon who took me through the journey that’s built him a multi-million-shilling business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What does an oil marketing company do exactly?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, an oil marketing company is one that imports oil into a country, usually regulated by government tenders, and then resells the oil to other oil companies or institutions at a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It’s been said that the oil industry is a closed industry, why?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason is the high capital investment needed, coupled with the high-risk factor due to stiff competition and potential for losses in daily operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much capital did you put into your business starting out?*\n",
    "\n",
    "My path into the oil industry started in 2013 with a petrol station. My start-up capital was Sh.7 million, which I recouped within two years, and I acquired three more stations in this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Take us through how you got to the point where you could raise Sh.7 million. What’s your background?*\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s something I don’t like talking about because my life as a young man was messy. I grew up in Ruai, Eastlands. My parents were business people, so we didn’t struggle for finances but many of my peers did. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think because my mind couldn’t come to terms with that, I ended up rebelling against the system. I got into a lot of trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was admitted into one of the top national schools, but I had difficulties following all the rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "My mother gave me a rosary and told me that no matter how much I rebelled, God would never give up on me. \n",
    "\n",
    "Her acceptance of who I was made me realise I wanted to be more and do better, for her. So I did.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How did you end up in oil?*\n",
    "\n",
    "After university, in 2003, I joined the banking industry. Ten years later, in the run-up to the 2013 elections, I decided to go into politics. \n",
    "\n",
    "I took leave from work to campaign and lost. I hadn’t informed my employer about my intentions but they found out, so when I got back to work, I was demoted. \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to quit the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time I was earning Sh.400,000 a month, but I had spent more than Sh.3 million during the elections. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "A friend approached me with a proposal to go into the oil business and I jumped at the opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*So how did you raise Sh.7 million?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ironically, I used my networks in the banking industry and borrowed against property, including the home I was living in. One of my good friends and business partners also used his own house as security for financing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*That was quite a risk, considering you were new to the industry.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, which is also what pushed me to succeed. I remember starting from the very bottom because I wanted to learn the ropes. \n",
    "\n",
    "My first eight months I worked as a pump attendant at my own station – the employees had no idea who I was.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What are some of the lessons you learned from your staff?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This will sound funny, but they taught me how to steal – from oil deliveries and from the cash register.\n",
    "\n",
    "I played along because, unknown to them, they were revealing the loopholes in the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "You lose oil at the depot because of the cartels involved, you lose oil in the trucks because the drivers siphon it enroute, you lose oil when it arrives at the station because what is recorded is different from the actual amounts delivered, and you lose oil on sales due to theft from attendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is there a solution for this?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried many options. For instance, there was a time I decided to follow a truck whose driver I suspected was stealing from me. \n",
    "\n",
    "I tracked him to a plot in Nairobi’s Industrial Area, but I was shot at by unknown characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "That was one of the scariest moments in my life.\n",
    "\n",
    "I reported the matter to the police but nothing came of it. That’s when I decided I couldn’t fight these thieves physically, but I could thwart them with technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What kind of technology are we talking about?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I partnered with a friend from high school who ran a company called Empire Microsystems, which deals in automating oil distribution from depot to customer, using intelligent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chip is embedded into every carrier of fuel from the tanks in the depot, the trucks transporting the fuel, the tanks at the stations and the fuel pumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "These chips digitally record the volume of fuel passing through these carriers and remit the information to our head office.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means we know exactly how many litres left the depot, how many litres are in the truck, how many litres are deposited into our station tanks, and how many litres are sold to customers. In case of loss, we can accurately trace where it occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Has it worked in reducing your losses?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Many fuel stations and oil marketing companies will record a loss of 4 per cent, while the acceptable rate of loss is 0.5 per cent to maximise on profits. \n",

    "\n",
    "There is no doubt that leaving behind a normal office job and becoming your own boss is exciting, and many of those who take that path indeed find personal and professional fulfillment there.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in any endeavor, it is better to be prepared with reality in mind than fantasy. And as far as entrepreneurship is concerned, the reality is really complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are 20 realities that no MBA degree program will prepare you for.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Just because someone else is doing it successfully, doesn’t mean it will work for you as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The “sky is the limit” is a cliché, but if you consistently set higher goals, you can make it a reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You will never be your own boss for your real boss is your customer. He calls the shots, and you must figure out how to respond to their revolving needs… all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will need a bit of luck to get past some hurdles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Networking is everything and the old adage “It’s not what you know, it is who you know” still holds true.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. There will always be someone who will seem more successful than you and it is PERFECTLY okey to be jealous – especially if this drives you to work even harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Ideas themselves are not worth much. It is the execution that separates the men from the boys.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Don’t get too excited about that million shillings idea you have just conjured from the thin air. Chances are that several people have already tried it and failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. It takes time to build a reliable customer base. Until then, you better be prepared to survive on inconsistent income.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. You will miss having a regular salary. Surviving on unpredictable income is not easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. 90% of opportunities that seem like they would be a good investment aren’t. Always test the waters first before jumping all in.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Your family and friends will not get what you are doing. Your mum will probably ask things like “Why can’t you get a normal job?”\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Stress gets to a whole new level when you become an entrepreneur. If you don’t learn how to deal with stress, you will probably succumb to it during the first 5 years of operating the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. No matter how well you hide, the tax man will one day catch up with you and you will not like it. And ooh! It hurts to pay in.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Deals will not come looking for you. You have to go fish them out from the streets. So you better work on your street smarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. There are many rewards for being an entrepreneur – but if quick riches is what you are looking for, then starting a business is not the best route to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. You will need to learn to pat your own back. The encouragement you need to succeed will hardly come from other people and you need to brew it from within – so keep telling yourself you are great.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. If you are female, lots of people will think your success is due to a man. The fact that you have single-handedly found your way to success will be unfathomable for most people.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. During the first few months, you might be broke than you have ever been and you may worry you will never be successful. This is called “Self-Doubt”, a very common thing in entrepreneurship.\n",

    "\n",
    "Are you aware that the construction sector is the fastest growing industry in Kenya currently? \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the recently released data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, construction industry grew at 13.6% faster than the financial and agriculture sectors which grew at 8.7% and 5.6% respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need rocket science to know where the big money is. Going by the recent trends, an investment in this massive industry would certainly be timely as well as rewarding especially due to factors such as devolution, discovery of oil and a growing middle class.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sorry for boring you with heavy jargon and numbers, I was just trying to help you see the opportunities that exist around you and what the future holds. Talking about opportunities, one incredible business idea from the construction industry is scaffolding rentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "My research has shown that Kenya has a serious shortage of scaffolds. Not many people have realized that it is possible to set up a small scaffolding rentals business with a small amount of capital. In my opinion, this is a ripe opportunity that is still under-exploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What Is Scaffolding Rentals Business All About*\n",
    "\n",
    "A scaffold is a temporary structure on the outside of a building that is being constructed. This structure can be used by workers to climb as they perform specialized tasks such as paint-work, building repairs or construction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another job of a scaffold is to hold concrete together in order to allow for formation of slab and pillars of a house under construction. Most constructors prefer to rent scaffolds as opposed to buying them as a way to save on cost and minimize liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Getting Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are planning to start on a small budget then its far much easier to start with wooden trappers and then you can advance to steel scaffolds as your business expands. \n",
    "\n",
    "So step one will be to find good quality pine/eucalyptus wood from the local timber yards. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kitengela would be a good place to begin your search although you can always expand your search to other parts of the region in order to get cheaper prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Ask for high quality 8 by 1 or 9 by 1 wood. Also ask for props.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Look For A Yard*\n",
    "\n",
    "A yard is basically an empty plot of land where you can keep your wood and props as you await customers to come rent them. This doesn’t have to be anything fancy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just a central area from where you will be running your operations from. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have an idle piece of land near a growing town center then this could be a brilliant way to put it to good use. Alternatively you can lease one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Look for a minimum 20x30ft piece of land that is accessible by motorized transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Plan For Transport*\n",
    "\n",
    "Because scaffolds are heavy items, it is important to plan on how you are going to be picking and delivering them to your clients. If you have a pick-up truck or a small lorry then you will have a slight advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you are just a small investor looking to start from scratch, then you will need to talk to transporters in your area and negotiate prices in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Typically it costs about Ksh.2,000 to hire a pickup truck for about 2 hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4: Print Brochures and Business Cards*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have everything catered for, you can boldly start approaching prospective customers and handing them your business cards and price list. Your customers will mostly be foremen, commercial and residential property developers and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Your price list should be based on the duration of rental period. For instance, a popular price tag on the Kenyan market is Ksh.100 for each wooden scaffold rented for 40 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Important Facts*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Consistent marketing and good service are important ingredients for reaching a wider market.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For short distance deliveries you can use a cart (mkokoteni) to deliver. A new mkokoteni will costs you Ksh.20,000 to acquire.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Consider charging delivery/pickup fees to boost your revenue. Alternatively, consider providing free transport to woo new customers if there is competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "*As you advance you can switch to steel scaffolds which have longer life than wooden ones. Each unit will cost you about Ksh.1,000 to acquire although the price varies depending on the international price of steel.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You can expect to lose about 10% of wooden scaffolds due to wear and tear during each rental period. Essentially that means you can re-use a load of wooden scaffolds for a maximum of 10 times before they get worn out completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Steel scaffolds can be re-used for a much longer time and they are preferred where unique building shapes are required (e.g. dome shaped buildings).\n",
    "\n",
    "*The average rental price for wooden scaffolds is Ksh.100, steel scaffolds Ksh.150 and props Ksh.25 so you can think out your pricing on that basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Apart from scaffolds other items that you can add to your rentals list include: bucket hoists, concrete mixers, shovels, vibrators, ladders and wheelbarrows.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Consider insuring your equipment to avoid unexpected loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Demand for scaffoldings rental is available throughout the country particularly due to the effects of devolution. Some prime areas include: Nairobi Metro region, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru and Meru.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The only mandatory license required is the county single business permit which will cost you about Ksh.10,000 per year at most.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum Estimates For Wooden Scaffolds\n",
    "\n",
    "200 Pieces of Eucalyptus Timber – Ksh.50,000 (Ksh.250 per piece)\n",
    "\n",
    "200 Pieces of Eucalyptus Props – Ksh.16,000 (Ksh.80 per piece)\n",
    "\n",
    "Transport To Your Yard – Ksh.10,000\n",

    "Others (Marketing, Miscellaneous) – Ksh.24,000\n",
    "\n",
    "TOTAL BUDGET = Ksh.100,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make a decent Ksh.1 Million per year on a small yard.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing about this business is that you don’t have to be involved in its day to day running. That means you can continue doing what you do best even as you leave this business to run in the background (provided there’s good marketing involved). \n",
    "\n",
    "Best of all, there is room for growth. The construction sector is a multi-billion venture and the future looks bright. So don’t hesitate, if you feel this is the kind of business that would resonate with your needs and passion, go ahead and give it a try.\n",

    "\n",
    "How comes many of million shillings lottery winners, well-paid athletes and wellmanaged entrepreneurs wake up one day to find they are broke?\n",
    "\n",
    "How comes a student works hard and smart in school to attain an ‘A’ grade to get the best and well-paying jobs, to afford basic needs and luxurious desires and be financially stable, but never achieves such desires fully?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it that some people work for other people? But why is it that money works for other people (a few) and other people (many) work for money?\n",
    "\n",
    "But how comes that ‘A’ students work for ‘C’ students, and ‘B’ students work for the government?\n",
    "\n",
    "Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the book, *Why “A” students work for “C” students and “B” students work for the government* asks: “How does a “C” student work for “A”? and frankly answers: “By studying what “A” students do not study.”\n",
    "\n",
    "We are in a crisis, he says. But the crisis is not that of money. The real crisis is in the education sector. The education systems we have teaches students how to be a successful employee rather than start their own business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crisis is caused by education systems that orient students towards finding a highpaying job rather than creating high-paying jobs, climbing the corporate ladder rather than how to create companies and corporate ladders, jobs security rather than financial freedom, and teach little to nothing about money.\n",
    "\n",
    "It persuades students to believe that with good grades they will earn a decent job that comes with a great salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The students upon graduation turn out to be intellectually capable but are financially daft. \n",
    "\n",
    "After a degree, the students go back to school to get masters and even a PhD to climb up the corporate ladder.\n",
    "\n",
    "He says that the education system has always focused on two types of education: academic and professional education, and rarely financial education.\n",
    "\n",
    "That academic education supports the general skills of learning such as how to read, write and solve arithmetic problems. Professional education provides specialized skills to earn a living. \n",
    "\n",
    "Out of this education, we get doctors, engineers, lawyers, business executives and accountants, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Kiyosaki, the mantra, *'go to school, get a decent job, earn more and be rich'* is an outdated and obsolete financial advice. This is because the Return on Investment (ROI) on education is now minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that is not to say, one should abandon going to school. The point is that one should change the approach and perspective of education. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is, go to school not to get a job but to create jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "They say: *'Give a man a fish and you feed him a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime'*. Kiyosaki asks: “Are our schools failing to teach students to fish? Or are our schools teaching students that they are entitled to their daily fish?”\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be the reason so many students come out of college looking for jobs. That is why so many people are dependent upon the government to provide jobs and basic life support.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Types of students*\n",
    "\n",
    "*‘A’ students*\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the academic-oriented students. He refers to ‘A’ students as managerial capitalists (CEOs & directors) running large corporations.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are employees and not entrepreneurs. They graduate from the finest schools. They did not start the business and do not own the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "They get paid whether they do a good or a bad job.\n",
    "\n",
    "These ‘A’ students are conditioned to think that making mistakes is bad and therefore, they avoid risks of making mistakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of them are content to know that 2 + 2 = 4. But most do not know how to turn 2 + 2 into millions or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "*‘B’ Students*\n",
    "\n",
    "Refers to bureaucrats who run the government. They know how to spend money but do not know how to make money. For them to get more money to spend, they increase taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‘B’ students are taught by ‘A’ students. They get paid whether they do an excellent job or a bad job. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you give a B students one shilling, they will spend a hundred shillings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*‘C’ Students*\n",
    "\n",
    "These are true capitalists. They are entrepreneurs who know how to take a shilling and turn it into a hundred shillings. \n",
    "\n",
    "They invest in businesses, products and services that create jobs \n",
    "and opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike ‘A’ students, the ‘C’ students want to know how to make 2 + 2= Ksh.4,000,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "To the capitalist, that kind of math is worth studying.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading this book *Why “A” students work for “C” students and “B” students work for the government* written by Robert Kiyosaki, without taking it with a pinch of salt can turn out to be one of those motivational books that will impart you with enthusiasm. \n",
    "\n",
    "After reading you will realize that enthusiasm without knowledge is no good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask yourself: \n",
    "\n",
    "*How do I quit my 8am – 5pm job?\n",
    "\n",
    "*How do I get some capital to invest in a business?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Am I willing to take some risks?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Are you willing to go from failure to failure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Know that entrepreneurship is not for everybody. But the most important thing is to be financially intelligent. For instance, if you are employed or own a small business, how do you spend your money?\n",
    "\n",
    "He says: “One reason why so many people struggle financially is that they cannot delay their gratification. Most people would run out and buy the Porsche, Mercedes or Prado on credit, using bad debt.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Being employed as a junior worker, senior manager or a CEO or running a small business doesn’t imply that you are an ‘A’ student forever. You simply need to learn the basics of a ‘C’ student: Know how to invest, take risks and learn from your mistakes.\n",

    "16/05/2022, 8:18 am - +254 701 711058: *AVOID THESE 10 MISTAKES IN YOUR 20S OR WATCH YOUR FUTURE GO TO WASTE*\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I must say although this article's title targets those in the 19 to 29 age bracket, most of the facts discussed in it are applicable in virtually every stage of life. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if you are past 30 and you think you have got some catching up to do, or if you are in your 20s and still struggling to figure what it means to be an adult, this is your opportunity to rise from the ashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(1) Giving Up Easily*\n",
    "\n",
    "The current generation is (no offense) mainly made of “cerelac babies” who naturally expect instant gratification and quick results. They want fast solutions and text-book ready answers to their problems. However, that’s not how life is supposed to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to appreciate that good things in life require a little bit more effort to be harnessed. And there goes our first lesson: Don’t be an early quitter, things don’t just pop-up abruptly like in the movies; patience is a virtue.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(2) Leaning Too Much On Your Parents*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were lucky to have parents who gave you Cerelac, took you to school and provided you with everything you needed; count yourself lucky (some of us had to hustle all the way up). The least you can do for yourself (and for them) now is to move on and start a new life.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are still living with your parents and you are approaching 30 years of age just know that you are committing an atrocity against the human society’s way of life. \n",
    "\n",
    "Come on, go out there and be your own man or woman. It surely won’t be easy, but this is the only way you can learn to be an independent and responsible adult.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(3) Mixing Money with Emotion*\n",
    "\n",
    "Money and emotion don’t mix. Ask the best investors in Nairobi and they will confirm to you that in order to succeed in wealth creation; you must learn to differentiate your emotional intuitions from your logical judgements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet majority of people in their 20s make this mistake too often. They rush to make permanent decisions based on temporary feelings. They take loans to fund weddings they otherwise could not afford.\n",
    "\n",
    "They go deep into debt as they buy luxurious items, which they can barely afford to maintain just so that they can prove a point to their “enemies”. But life doesn’t work like that! Major decisions have to be made based on logic and not emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(4) Thinking You’re The Only One Of Your Friends Struggling*\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you noticed how digital media is effective at making big things look small and small things look way bigger than they are in real life? \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I pose for a photo in the car driver’s seat of my rich uncle’s Ferrari and post it on Instagram then all my friends are going to think that I have made it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, deep down inside I know that my bank account is running empty, but I will certainly not reveal that to my followers on social media because I want them to envy me without asking questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s how life is nowadays.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you see is barely what you get. So ditch that mentality that everyone is making it except you. Remember, life is a Marathon not a sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(5) Not Building a Good Relationship with Financial Institutions*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever have dreams of investing in multiple streams of income and becoming a notable person someday then you must start working on your credit records right away. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring that meager HELB loan that helped you sail through college could work against you one day in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, taking those bank overdrafts and salary advances might end up doing more harm than good. So be disciplined right now and stick to a small but manageable personal budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, don’t “eat” all your earnings open a bank account or a SACCO and nurture a saving culture early enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(6) Not Hanging Out With People Who Are Older Than You*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you spend most of your time glued to social media and flipping between your best friends and drinking buddies, you are really limiting your potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, old people may seem a bit boring, but in reality they do have a lot of wisdom which is why you should hang out with them as often as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, that little more wisdom they offer is all you need to excel in real life…and how can you get it if you spend all your days in jealousy-inducing and name-calling orgies on social media? \n",
    "\n",
    "Make it a point to spend time with an old person at least once a month – thank me later.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(7) Indulging In Drugs and Alcohol*\n",
    "\n",
    "I don’t think this needs a lengthy explanation. Drugs and alcohol will not only ruin your life but also shorten it. Instead of spending more time thinking about growing your business empire you will spend more time switching between a rehab and a police cell – so don’t do drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(8) Waiting For The Perfect Moment*\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you still waiting for the perfect moment to launch your business? Still waiting for the perfect moment to make a bold decision? Well, guess what, the perfect moment never arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I always put it, you can seldom win a marathon race by standing still at the starting line. You have to get going even when the odds seem to be against you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Else, you will be stuck in a life of procrastination only to realize how much time you wasted when a retrenchment letter comes your way; too late.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(9) Worrying About Things You Can’t Control*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control a lot in your life, but sometimes finding true freedom means appreciating what you can’t change. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can’t change your looks. You can’t change your family. You can’t change your IQ. And you can’t change your past.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more you continue to worry about these things, the more time and energy you will waste. So instead of dwelling on your imperfections, the best way to spend your 20s is by only focusing on what you can change i.e. your future…and while at it, always appreciate who you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(10) Going Back To School for a Degree or Masters*\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you are in a career where more academic prowess is directly required (e.g. medical research, lecturing), taking a hefty loan to go for that degree (or Masters) course might not make much sense to your bottom line after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, don’t go back for those academic papers just because your friends are doing it. Only go back to class if you are looking for more knowledge, not so that you can get more money. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going back for a second degree for purely monetary desires (e.g. getting a job promotion) is similar to investing in more buckets to carry water from the river instead of building a pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "So ask yourself, do you want to carry larger and heavier buckets or do you want to build a pipeline that will continue bringing water to your family even when you are gone? The choice is yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that was one long article, and i appreciate the fact that you have read it keenly to the end. I hope you have learnt something new.\n",

    "16/05/2022, 3:33 pm - +254 754 839228: *HOW TO START SUPPLYING BUILDING MATERIALS IN KENYA*\n",
    " \n",
    "Dear entrepreneurs, with real estate sector, now thriving, building materials such as sand, ballast, and building stones are in great demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Everywhere buildings are coming up as people build their homes and housing companies build estates.\n",
    " \n",
    "You can start supplying stones, sand, and ballast to these projects and be part of this real estate boom. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is simple, it involves buying and transporting these materials in order to those building houses. \n",
    " \n",
    "I will mainly concentrate on those around Nairobi and environs and on the sand, building stones and ballast, though there are many other materials you can supply.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Equipment*\n",
    " \n",
    "The only equipment needed for this business is a well-maintained lorry of good capacity. Many banks such as NIC Bank specialize in asset finance and can advance you some money towards the purchase of a lorry for this business. \n",
    " \n",
    "Other banks can also advance you loans as long as you meet their terms and conditions. At the moment, Kenya Commercial Bank has a deal with Tata trucks where they can finance within certain terms and conditions.\n",
    " \n",
    "This business requires a big capacity lorry such as 7,000 tonnes and above. It also requires a well maintained or new lorry. Makes such as Isuzu are good but will cost more. Tata and Mitsubishi are equally good but mostly when new. \n",
    "\n",
    "With over Ksh.1 Million, you may get a good lorry which can start you off. A new Tata may go for Ksh.3 Million to Ksh.5 Million depending on capacity.\n",
    " \n",
    "There are dealers who can give you a truck on down payment of anything from 50% then the rest is paid monthly for a period of 12 months, 24 months or more plus other conditions depending on the agreement.\n",
    " \n",
    "As usual, if you opt to go for a used truck, be ready to have a reliable mechanic thoroughly check and test the engine before committing. In any case, don’t even think of going for a very old truck, you may never have peace of mind.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Stones*\n",
    " \n",
    "Quarry stones are available in Lukenya, Tala, and other quarries while machine cut stones are available mostly in Juja. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many other quarries sell machine cut stones but those from Juja have been known to be more durable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stones have various grades, quality, and sizes. You must choose the right stones depending on your customer requirements.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Ballast*\n",
    " \n",
    "Ballast (kokoto) is available from quarries in Mlolongo, Kitengela, and others. There are various sizes depending on the work to be done.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Sand*\n",
    " \n",
    "Unlike stones and ballast, and is not from quarries. Many dealers mine sand from river beds in Ukambani, Kajiado, Ngong, Mai Mahiu and many other places. \n",
    "\n",
    "The buying cost of sand will depend on where it is mined from. Some dealers collect free after paying local brokers or authorities.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Sales*\n",
    " \n",
    "In this business, good networking is very important. You may never get any business without relying on contacts. You need to develop good contacts among fundis, contractors, quarry owners, colleagues, other dealers, brokers, relatives and friends. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is through these people that you will get business.\n",
    " \n",
    "Your costing will mostly be based on transportation costs to locations where the materials are to be delivered. You need to know the most cost effective location to get the materials from, bearing in mind the quality too. \n",
    " \n",
    "For example, delivery of machine cut stones to places such as Syokimau, Mlolongo, Rongai, Town Centre, Westlands, Industrial Area may cost between Ksh.50 — Ksh.55 per piece depending on quantity. \n",
    " \n",
    "Normal quarry stones are sold in terms of running feet. 600ft or 800ft may sell for between Ksh.25,000 to Ksh.45,000 depending again on the quarry, quality, size and location where they are to be delivered and mode of transport.\n",
    " \n",
    "Ballast is mostly sold for approximately Ksh.1,000 or Ksh.1,200 per tonne at the quarry. You will charge your clients inclusive of transport depending on where they are located and tonnage of your lorry. \n",
    " \n",
    "Equally, sand is sold inclusive of transport therefore, make good estimates depending on the tonnage of your lorry and fuel consumption. A 20 tonne lorry can deliver with Ksh.35,000 to areas such as Kayole or Embakasi.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Returns*\n",
    " \n",
    "The returns in this business will depend on several factors. Since the business income is mostly based on transport, the consumption of your lorry will play a major role. \n",
    "\n",
    "Old vehicles consume more fuel than new vehicles of the same engine capacity under the same load, therefore, if your lorry in much older and in poor mechanical condition, you will lose some income on fuel consumption.\n",
    " \n",
    "With good contacts and connections, you can make between Ksh.30,000 and Ksh.100,000 per day on average, after paying the driver, turn-boy, county government levies, and after fueling for the next day. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you get a contract where an estate or gated community is being built, then you will literally be laughing all the way to the bank, everyday.\n",
    " \n",
    "Avoid trouble with the police by having your lorry in good condition, with valid inspection sticker and insurance cover. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it is on loan, some banks will insist that you install a tracking device at your cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, ensure that you have made arrangements for a secure place where your lorry will be parked overnight, not far away from your area of operation.\n",
    " \n",
    "The initial investment in this business is high, but with good connections, returns are also high, and since several financial institutions have packages that can help you acquire a lorry, why not start researching on this business now? \n",
    " \n",
    "Your research should include the location of quarries, prices of materials, lorry types and capacities, weigh bridges, financing options, contacts and other aspects of this business.\n",
    " \n",
    "When Joseph Kamau Kiminda decided to start a business specializing in construction material, his friends and relatives — including his parents — discouraged him, saying he was too young.\n",
    " \n",
    "In 2010, aged just 22, Kamau decided to invest the little money he had saved while still a university student to start May Quarry Mines which supplies building materials in Kiambu and Nairobi.\n",
    " \n",
    "In the beginning, he had no problems delivering the small orders.\n",
    " \n",
    "However, when he landed the occasional big orders, he would take the materials from the quarry on credit and would pay after the client had paid for the deliveries. This, he said, earned him the trust of his suppliers.\n",
    " \n",
    "Before he went into the business – a gender development studies graduate – Kamau used to write proposals from Non-Governmental Organisations at a fee. Initially, he never had any interest in business, because with a degree he expected to be employed. He however changed his mind after one of his friends invited him to visit his firm, which also supplied building materials.\n",
    " \n",
    "This, he says, inspired him to borrow a leaf from his friend and he does not regret venturing into the business.\n",
    " \n",
    "“When I left the university, I had saved about Sh.500,000 and when I decided to go into the construction materials business, my parents and friends said I wasn’t mature enough. They thought it would never work for me and they kept telling me I should quit and get employed,” Kamau said.\n",
    " \n",
    "He refused to bow to the discouragement and as time went by, his business grew forcing his parents to support it.\n",
    " \n",
    "He started supplying materials to individuals but today, his main customers are real estate companies based in Kiambu where the housing business has boomed in recent years.\n",
    " \n",
    "“I have supplied materials to Migaa estate and also to Eden Ville,” Kamau said.\n",
    " \n",
    "His company deals with all building materials, ranging from sand, building stones to ballast and ventilations blocks which are moulded at his company’s marketing site along Kiambu Road.\n",
    " \n",
    "He also supplies mazeras stones, pavement blocks and other building accessories.\n",
    " \n",
    "In future, he said he wants to be one of the recognized suppliers, saying there are no impossible mountains in business and the only requirement is determination, hard work and patience.\n",
    " \n",
    "However, like other businesses, he is still facing major challenges but what baffles him the most is when potential clients deny him tenders due to his age.\n",
    " \n",
    "“Big companies have on several occasions denied me orders claiming they do not trust me because I am too young,” he said.\n",
    " \n",
    "Despite his challenges, he urges young people not to stay at home and wait for white collar jobs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many farmers rush to buy new chicken breeds coming into the market without knowing their qualities only to end up with regrets and losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Poultry keeping is now one of the most popular agribusiness enterprises that many people in Kenya want to go into.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many farmers rush into it without the most basic information on how they can do it the right way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quail fiasco few years ago no doubt left many farmers with empty pockets when they made huge investments in quail rearing leading to glut in the market and a fall in prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many farmers do not seem to have learnt a lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there are a lot of rumors, and misguided exaggerations about new chicken breeds that are said to do much better than local indigenous breeds in production, enticing farmers to spend a lot of their money in search of the breeds which they only learnt about in newspaper articles and adverts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this issue, we would like to shed light on the breeds available in the country and their qualities so that farmers can make informed decisions on the best type of breed they can keep to get good returns by making the best choice from the various breeds in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Improved KARI indigenous chicken*\n",
    "\n",
    "The KARI Improved Indigenous chicken breed is one of the most popular breeds in the country at the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chickens can produce more eggs and meat compared to local indigenous chickens. \n",
    "\n",
    "The breed can also do well in areas with harsh climatic conditions such as the arid and semi-arid regions in Northern Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chicken can be reared in free range conditions especially for farmers who want to produce chickens organically. \n",
    "\n",
    "When properly managed, the KARI Improved hens can lay between 220 to 280 eggs a year. \n",
    "\n",
    "A hen from this breed can attain 1.5kg in 5 months. A cock weighs 2kg over the same period if they are well-fed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The breed has a quiet temperament, excellent feathering and is able to adapt fast to the conditions under which it is kept compared to other breeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment there is a huge demand for KARI Improved chickens across the country such that KARI is unable to supply farmers who need this breed. But efforts are being made to train farmers who can breed the chickens and sell to other farmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Kenbro chicken*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kenbro breed is a dual-purpose (meant for eggs and meat production) breed which was specifically developed to serve the western Kenya market that has a high demand for chickens. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was introduced into the country about a decade ago by Kenchic Ltd to meet the demand for farmers who would prefer a breed that requires less intensive management than hybrid chickens. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kenbro is more resistant to diseases compared to hybrid birds. It can survive on free range. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bird matures faster with proper feeding and starts laying eggs at 5 months. It can attain up to 4kg with proper feeding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kenchic produces more than 20,000 birds from this breed in a week but some farmers breed the birds and sell to others. The quality of birds produced by such farmers is low because it is only the company that has the parent stock that can produce high quality birds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kenbro is a heavy feeder and this is one reason it is able to put more weight than other indigenous chickens.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Kuroiler chicken*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kuroiler is a dual-purpose breed that was introduced in Uganda in the year 2009 from Keggs Farms, India. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like Kenbro, Kuroiler can survive on free range, but they need to feed continuously, a reason why they put on weight faster than indigenous chickens; at 4 months Kuroiler chickens can weigh up to 3kg and 4kg in 6 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers rearing this breed say it has tastier meat compared to indigenous chickens; their meat is also soft and tender. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its eggs are larger than those of indigenous chickens. A Kuroiler hen can lay between 140-150 eggs in a year. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Kuroiler’s quality goes down when they are crossed with indigenous chickens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers keeping them say Kuroiler birds are scavengers that can live on household food leftovers and related agricultural waste. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like local indigenous chickens, Kuroiler chickens are resistant to most diseases although farmers are advised to vaccinate them in the same way they do other chickens.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one big disadvantage with Kuroiler chickens is that the hens cannot sit on their eggs to hatch. Many farmers discover this fact too late. Kuroiler chickens are therefore suitable only for farmers with incubators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Small- scale farmers in the rural areas who rely on hens to hatch chicks can only order fresh stock of chicks every time they want new stock for breeding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed poultry farmers in rural areas in Uganda are already raising questions on the sustainability of this breed among resource poor communities who cannot manage to buy new stocks every time they want to rear new batches of birds.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Unless the government sets up hatcheries at the village level, small-scale farmers will be exposed to businessmen with hatcheries, who will increase chicks prices or even charge them more for hatchery services,“ says Henry Kijanji, a poultry farmer in Mafubira Sub-county, Jinja, Uganda in a telephone interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Rainbrow Rooster chicken*\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the Kuroiler breed, Rainbow Rooster is dual purpose breed meaning that farmers can keep it for both meat and eggs, multi-coloured dual purpose, low input bird which can be put on free range. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is a heavy feeder, which is able to put on weight fast attaining 3kg to 4kg in 6 months. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, like the Kuroiler breed, the Rainbow Rooster hen cannot sit on the eggs to hatch; so farmers who want to keep this breed must have an incubator for hatching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The breed is therefore not suitable for small-scale farmers in the rural areas who cannot be able to buy incubators mainly for lack of electricity supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "We have received many calls and WhatsApp messages in the past months from different Agripreneurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these people (unfortunately) called us after they had already made some serious mistakes and there was nothing or little we could do to help them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have met so many Kenyans including my parents, making mistakes in poultry farming business and losing their money. \n",
    "\n",
    "How can people work hard (for 5 to 10 years) to save money, then put the money into a business, only to make mistakes and lose it all? \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s painful and I don’t want it to happen to you.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you pay attention, you might have noticed that most businesses (like more than 70%) fail all over the world.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Most people who start a business in Africa never for a time “fall in love” with business.\n",

    "It’s the truth.\n",

    "\n",
    "If everyone could get a good job, no condition attached, how many people do you think would consider starting a business?\n",
    "\n",
    "Or let me make this question personal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have the opportunity of getting a job that pays Ksh.500,000 per month, would you think of ever starting your own business?\n",
    "\n",
    "For most people, the answer is NO.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "With an estimated 50,000 graduates that Kenyan universities produce every year not to mention other graduates from vocational training institutions, unemployment is becoming a real disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows therefore that there is need for business ideas that can help, especially the youth to get engaged in and make a living and the bottled water distribution business is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Kenya, bottled water market continues to thrive with sales estimated at Sh.12 billion per year and over 100 brands available can provide a niche market for distributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being one of the essential commodities in every society, water actually falls under fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) that sales quickly and at a relatively low cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Sh.300,000 you can venture in the distribution of bottled mineral water and be sure of making cool cash on a weekly basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can start by buying some two second hand motorcycles which are relatively cheaper as compared to tuktuks or band new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several online sites in Kenya where you can find people selling secondhand motorcycles at between Sh.35,000 and Sh.55,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a Tornado of 125cc and still in high performance can be found at Sh.35,000 on pigiame.co.ke while a Boxer Bajaj of 150cc goes at Sh.40,000 on the same site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume you settle on two that costs Sh.40,000 each of which you can operate one as you employ another person to help you with the other, you will still remain with Sh.220,000 that can enable you to go for some bottles of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Sh.15 each (wholesale price), you can actually buy 14,666 bottles of 300ml which you can distribute at Sh.17 per bottle and make an extra Sh.2 per bottle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will arrive you at Sh.249,322 translating to Sh.29,322 gross profit a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you minus about Sh.9,000, your operation costs which include fuel, labor and other expenses weekly, you will remain with Sh.20,000 in a single week, Sh.80,000 net income in a month‬.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make more than this if you can stock and distribute more bottles in a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this will depend on the effort put to realize daily goals as with business you need to be timely and consistent to match or even outdo your competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the wholesale price of the 300ml mineral water bottles can be increased to Sh.25 from Sh.15 given the fluctuation nature of the Kenyan market, you can still make some profit just at a distribution rate of 2 bob per bottle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In business, it is that small margin that will make your service be sought-after by your clients and hence have an edge over your competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, in every business there are risks but it takes a leap of faith to invest in ideas which are well calculated, planned and implemented to realize good returns.\n",

    "\n",
    "The world of business changes frequently. For instance, some time back the coolest business to do was that of “Simu Ya Jamii”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many people invested in it as there were decent profits to be earned.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, today the business is no longer doing well because most customers eventually bought their own mobile phones and the needs of the market changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warren Edward Buffett (one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the world today) teaches us that if you want to survive in business you have to keep evolving.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1936 Buffet started off selling chewing gum, a few years later he was selling coca cola drinks… by age 17 he noticed that there were bigger opportunities in opening a Kinyozi and pin-ball gaming business. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the time he was 19 he saw opportunities in stock trading and knew it was time to move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise for you, you should always be prepared to change your tact to suit changing times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t just start a Kinyozi and switch off your brain… keep advancing your Kinyozi idea and combine it with your newly learned experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way you will keep evolving and no amount of change will push you out of business!\n",
    "\n",
    "Also re-invest at least 50% of your profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most small business owners start out by pocketing whatever the business earns, they think that any profit generated by the business is their salary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "They never think of re-inventing, upgrading or growing their business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting small isn’t the same as thinking small.\n",
    "\n",
    "That you are planning to start a small business doesn`t mean you must think small. Every today giant business started small.\n",

    "\n",
    "You had to go and buy cola drink with your cup or jug. That was odd, isn`t it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Google started in a garage. Facebook started in a room. Just name that big business and you will probably see it began so small.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the owners of today`s big companies never thought small.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think small, you will remain small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always think of growth. Always think of expansion. Always think like a giant, even as you are just starting that business in a little way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people who have small businesses (especially in Kenya and Africa) usually start and pray that customers come. They don`t do anything about marketing their businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a business is hard, but growing a business is even harder. Any foolish person can start a business, but only smart entrepreneur can make a business successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coca Cola that`s today the most valuable and the most famous product in the world was started by a smart Chemist but a poor business man, John Pemberton. \n",

    " \n",
    "Kenya and many other African countries face huge problems of transport not only because of bad roads but due to limited means of transport. \n",
    "\n",
    "This situation presents to your business opportunities in the transport sector. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can make an entry to this transport sector by starting a pick-up transport business. This business involves carrying goods for others from one place to another at a fee.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Pick-up Truck*\n",
    " \n",
    "Your main requirement for this business will be a reliable pick-up truck. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of pickups in the market to choose from. Toyota (Hilux), Nissan, (Datsun, Sahara, Hardbody), Isuzu (Tougher, D-Max), Mitsubishi and to some extent Mazda are some of the most reliable pickups in Kenya at the moment. \n",
    " \n",
    "Peugeot 504 is cheaper but not very reliable. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be safer buying your own pick-up for this business. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a start, go for a used pick-up to keep your costs low, but don’t fall for a junk which will cripple your business with breakdowns every now and then.\n",
    " \n",
    "A good pick-up truck, used but in a good condition that will meet your needs as you start your transport business, will cost you between Ksh.500,000 — Ksh.1,000,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "The price will largely depend on the condition, make and the year of manufacture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some may even cost much higher but when deciding which one to buy, your budget should dictate how high you can go. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will, therefore, be your major cost item in this business and it will be the heart of the business.\n",
    " \n",
    "When you settle for the pick-up truck you want to buy, two things are very important; confirm true ownership by doing a search at the registrar of motor vehicles and also confirm true condition by having a trusted and experienced mechanic thoroughly inspect the body and the engine and do a road test. \n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, you will get real value for your money and you will also avoid being conned.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Insurance*\n",
    " \n",
    "By law, you must insure your pick-up to get it on the road. \n",
    "\n",
    "Look for a reputable insurance company and apply for insurance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many companies will charge you about 4% of the insured value of the vehicle when insured comprehensively. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your pick-up is too old, most companies will only accept third-party insurance, costing about Ksh.6,000 — Ksh.8,000 per year.\n",
    " \n",
    "You are required to display a valid insurance sticker on your windscreen at all times, therefore, ensure this is done.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Inspection*\n",
    " \n",
    "The law requires that all commercial vehicles undergo annual inspection at the Motor Vehicle Inspection Unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since your pick-up is a commercial vehicle, you are required to take it for inspection and display a valid inspection sticker on the windscreen. \n",
    "\n",
    "The vehicle must be in good condition to pass and be issued with a valid inspection sticker.\n",
    " \n",
    "Things like brakes, both foot and hand brake, lights, windows, engine and the general body must be in good condition to pass the test.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Location*\n",
    " \n",
    "This pick-up transport business requires some location to operate from. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the place where your clients will meet you and hire you for transport service. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal locations include outside or next to a busy mall or supermarket, outside large and busy hardware shops, around major construction sites, near a big market or shopping center or just around the residential estates.\n",
    " \n",
    "People in these areas will need some form of transportation as they shop for bulky and heavy things such as mattresses, beds, sofa sets, fridges, cookers, hardware and building materials while others may need to transport household goods from one place to another.\n",
    " \n",
    "Position your vehicle in a clear and visible place where people can see you. You may display a sign to show that you offer transport services and include your contact details.\n",
    " \n",
    "Alternatively or in addition to carrying items around, you can also go to places out of town and buy foodstuff such as cereals, vegetables, and potatoes from farmers and bring to towns to sell at a higher price to increase your income. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will require wide networks with farmers and sellers in markets in and around town.\n",
    " \n",
    "The competition will be tight in many locations. Just be sure to offer good service and keep your vehicle in good condition and keep contacts with clients who may need your services.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Income*\n",
    " \n",
    "A good way of estimating how much to charge for your services is to have a rough idea of your vehicle’s fuel consumption per kilometer. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind and the distance you have to cover, you can work out a good amount to charge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clients will always bargain meaning it is best to always add a premium to the ideal estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Standard charges range from Ksh.1,000 to ksh.5,000 depending on the route and distance to be covered.\n",
    " \n",
    "Many pick-up transporters collect between Ksh.3,500 — ksh.6,000 net per day. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a driver, you will part with anything between Ksh.500 — Ksh.1,500 per day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some days may be dry and you may end up with nothing or less than Ksh.1,000 net at the end of the day.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Challenges*\n",
    " \n",
    "Keeping your pick-up in good condition will be a challenge in this business. \n",
    "\n",
    "With roads in many areas in bad condition, servicing the vehicle will be very important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the service schedule strictly to avoid unnecessary breakdowns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your clients will be very inconvenienced in case the vehicle breaks down when you have been hired.\n",
    " \n",
    "Traffic police have some unexplained affinity towards pickups and you have to be ready for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "They will never fail to stop the vehicle whenever they see it or get the slightest opportunity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way out of this is to keep your pick-up clean and in good condition all the time. \n",
    " \n",
    "Of special importance is to ensure your tires are in good condition, the brake lights and other lights are working well, inspection and insurance stickers are valid and displayed, your driving license is valid and available on the spot, you do not overload, do not carry goods protruding from the pick-up among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you do this, chances are that they will still stop you but you may always be spared.\n",
    " \n",
    "Mechanics can also give you serious challenges in this business, especially roadside mechanics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain a reliable and trusted mechanic who will always be the one to service or repair your pick-up when the time comes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not just call up any mechanic you see when you have a problem unless it is an absolute emergency. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will keep your vehicle in good condition and you will have a good maintenance history.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you drive the pick-up yourself, you will avoid the headache of having a driver but if you have no time to do that, you will need a driver. \n",
    "\n",
    "Drivers can be a big problem because many of them may want to make some extra money on the side as they work for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge can be controlled or reduced by installing tracker on the vehicle and setting a daily target amount that he must bring in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Agree on a target amount with the driver and make it reasonable and achievable.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "As we always tell you, there’s no marathon race that has ever been won by those who did not start the race. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you like the idea discussed above and you have what it takes to actualize it… then don’t wait to start… just do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, don't forget to join our training on Poultry Farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have received many calls and WhatsApp messages in the past months from different Agripreneurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these people (unfortunately) called us after they had already made some serious mistakes and there was nothing or little we could do to help them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have met so many Kenyans making mistakes in poultry farming business and losing their money. \n",
    "\n",
    "How can people work hard (for 5 to 10 years) to save money, then put the money into a business, only to make mistakes and lose it all? \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s painful and I don’t want it to happen to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the reason why we have organized for a Poultry Farming Training to educate you and to help you with our years of experience in business and poultry farming world. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called *POULTRY FARMING TRAINING* \n",

    "\n",
    "The first thing that catches your eye when you arrive at Leamose Poultry Farm is a flock of multi-coloured indigenous chicken darting joyously from side to side inside a wire mesh fenced compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "The farm at Kabiruini village near the Nyeri showground and Dedan Kimathi University of Technology belongs to Leah Muthoni who crossbreeds indigenous chicken with exotic ones to improve productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leah likes the crossbreed chickens because they are resistant to diseases and mature faster than the local Kienyeji chicken.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found Leah in a green apron cleaning the water traps inside one of the chicken cages while feeding them with maize germ.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Cleanliness is what has ensured my chickens do not contract diseases easily,” she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leah is keeping over 200 indigenous mature chickens, after she sold more than 500 others.\n",
    "\n",
    "She supplies the eggs and sells the mature birds to hotels and various supermarkets in Nyeri town. She also sells chicks to other farmers who come from as far away as Laikipia, Meru and Kirinyaga.\n",
    "\n",
    "The farmer went into poultry farming in 2013, with six Kienyeji chickens.\n",
    "\n",
    "“My husband, a former police officer, then went to the bank and got me a loan of Sh.400,000 with which I bought a hatchery, brooders, a water tank and water traps. I also installed electricity and constructed cages.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She then enrolled in a poultry farming training which was organised by the Ministry of Agriculture.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is here that she was introduced to the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation improved kienyeji chicken, now just referred to Kari Kienyeji after the institution’s former name.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The chickens are highly resistant to diseases and have high productivity levels in terms of egg and meat quality,” she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "She went on and bought a number of indigenous breeds, the local Kienyeji chickens, the Kari Naivasha, the Kenbro, Kuroiler and the Dorep indigenous chickens putting them all in separate cages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In another separate cage, Leah started cross-breeding the local Kienyeji chicken with the cocks from the Kuroiler, Dorep and Kenbro chicken breed which are known to gain weight faster than the local Kienyeji.\n",
    "\n",
    "These improved chickens can gain weight of up to 4.5kg when mature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon after the hen starts laying, the eggs are kept inside a locally made hatchery for 21 days and then the new cross bred bird is hatched.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chicks are then transferred to a different cage where they are fed with chick mash for seven weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "She then transfers them from the chicks cage to a cage where they can move freely until they are four to six months when they are ready for sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can also be sold as three-week old chicks. They go for Sh.150 each. The remaining chicks are then reared until three months before she allows them to mix with other chickens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leah says she is able to hatch over 200 chicks every month from the different breeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "She notes just like the Improved Kari Naivasha indigenous chickens, her cross-bred indigenous chickens have very few health problems after being vaccinated and their eggs are larger than the local Kienyeji chickens.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The fact that I am rearing indigenous chickens has made my business to thrive in the region where many prefer them to exotic ones.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She vaccinates the chicken after every two to three months against, especially, Newcastle disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chicks are injected for the first time two weeks after hatching.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Wairimu Kariuki, the chairperson of the Kenya Poultry Farmers Association, improved indigenous chickens are cheap and easy to rear.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The cross-bred chickens have all the characteristics of indigenous chickens but with an added advantage of laying more eggs and maturing faster than the local indigenous ones.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She says after the Kari improved indigenous chicken, farmers have been trying different ways of cross-breeding local chickens with exotic ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wairimu said cross-breeding local Kienyeji chicken with the Dorep results in bigger birds which fetch a lot of money when sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "She, however, warns that farmers who are cross-breeding their chickens should always ensure that the locally cross-bred ones are kept in separate cages from the original breeds to ensure they don’t extinguish the original traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "She says poultry farmers should vaccinate the chicken after every 10 weeks to keep away diseases like Newcastle which is a big threat to poultry farmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wairimu also says farmers should ensure that the chicken cages are cleaned regularly and provide enough water for them to grow healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep them healthy, Leah feeds the birds with kitchen waste, sunflowers, cereals, fish meal, green grass and maize germ.\n",
    "\n",
    "She keeps her chickens in a large fully fenced compound where they can scavenge and get insects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chickens are sold in terms of kilos with each going for Sh.450. She is able to raise Sh.120,000 monthly from selling the crossbred chickens, the original breed chicks and eggs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fertilized eggs from the Kenbro, the Dorep indigenous chickens and the cross-bred indigenous chickens are always in high demand with one selling at between Sh.30 to Sh.35. The eggs from the local Kienyeji go for between Sh.20 to Sh.25.\n",

    "\n",
    "Whether you love or hate politics, there is no denying that politicians influence our lives in a big way. \n",
    "\n",
    "While some are busy propagating hate speech, others are busy coordinating scandals and some are busy asking others to resign.\n",
    "\n",
    "The world of politics is really like a market full of mad men but if you take time to think about it, you will notice that there are many helpful lessons we can borrow from the ever-fiery political class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are 4 not-so-good lessons we all need to borrow from Kenya’s unique breed of lawmakers, and apply in our businesses and life.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Never Accept Defeat*\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when the winner wins with a landslide, the loser never accepts defeat. \n",
    "\n",
    "And even if he accepts defeat, he will complain that the election was either “rigged” or the votes were mysteriously “stolen”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, whether that’s democratic or not, that kind of resistance goes a long way in cementing the loser’s position as a worthy competitor in future polls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, in business, you should never let your losses and failures overrun your conscience and beliefs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Always rise above your defeats… and fight back to regain your dominance. \n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn’t matter how many times you fail, there is always a fighting chance in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just NEVER concede defeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Never Let Your Enemy Work In Peace*\n",
    "\n",
    "In Kenyan politics you have to keep bashing your enemies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your work, especially if you are in the opposition, is to destabilize the ruling party by consistently unearthing scandals and whining about every small mistake. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are in the ruling party, your work is to discredit the opposition as much as possible and to weaken them whenever there’s a chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, am not telling you to bad-mouth your competition in business, what am trying to say is that you should always be several steps ahead of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Never let them dominate the market as you watch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Never let them diminish your influence as you watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do everything it takes even if it means working late into the night, hiring the best talent or copyrighting your ideas to ward off copy-cats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just NEVER give your enemy breathing space.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Never Let Go Of Your Grassroot Support*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every politician knows the therapeutic benefits of retreating to their tribal backyard to rekindle support prior to launching a successful political career. \n",
    "\n",
    "They have mastered this art so well that even when credible complaints are raised against them; their clans and tribesmen automatically feel “targeted” or at risk of losing collective political control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed politicians have cast a spell on their grassroot supporters and it is no wonder their supporters are always ready to risk it all to guarantee their political survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things aren’t much different in the world of business either. Building a business without a strong customer base is similar to building a house on sand – it will be swept away when the Elnino strike!\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create loyal support you need to invest in good networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take advantage of networking sessions, county expos and digital media to regularly strengthen your bonds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly never ever lose touch of your markets’ needs and expectations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just NEVER lose touch of your grassroot support.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Never Keep Quiet*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our politicians are alive to the fact that there is always a general election coming every five years and so they don’t stop campaigning. \n",
    "\n",
    "They know that the moment they keep quiet the media will stop giving the coverage and they will gradually diminish from the limelight thus losing some political clout.\n",
    "\n",
    "So they keep stirring controversies and making fiery utterances hoping to grab your attention and possibly get a hashtag trending on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "And just like our politicians need to cause a bit of noise to remind us of their existence, your business needs you to go out there and make some meaningful noise as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t be ashamed to talk about your product whenever you come across potential market or potential investors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep shouting even if no one seems to take you seriously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes consistent noise is all it takes to land that bulk order, venture capital deal or viral attention. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just NEVER take a break from marketing – your lifeline is pegged to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "While politics and entrepreneurship may superficially appear to be worlds apart, consider the fact that both require a decent investment in outreach strategies to shape sentiments and attract new followers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the big question here is: what is the political game plan of your business going forward?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you think about it, don't forget to join our training on Poultry Farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have received many calls and WhatsApp messages in the past months from different Agripreneurs. \n",

    "\n",
    "With the current shocking rates of unemployment, more and more young people are turning into entrepreneurship as a full career with most youth even starting a business while still in university. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite all the challenges young entrepreneurs face such as raising capital, lack of experience, balancing personal and business life, and lacking mentors, one other major obstacle they face is struggling to be taken seriously in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Young entrepreneurs are often dismissed by doubtful investors and most times they have to prove their worth more than their older, more experienced counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you a young entrepreneur?\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot expect to be taken seriously as a young entrepreneur when the crowd you hang around are ‘jokers’ and people with no vision or goals in life. \n",
    "\n",
    "The saying, “Show me your friend and I’ll tell you what you are” rings true in this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you hang out with people who:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Push you to be a better person and not distract you from your goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Have a positive attitude towards life and cheer you on.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Challenge you by asking the tough questions and giving you a different perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Listen and are genuinely interested in what you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Have their own vision and goals. Seeing them work has a direct impact on your mindset.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Are more experienced and can give you advice and direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also work on Your Personal Appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my most thought provoking quotes is, “You never get a second chance to make a great first impression.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you like it or not, investors and influencers in the business world will always judge you based on your personal appearance, intelligence and the first impression you create.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are smartly dressed, it boosts your confidence and others treat you with respect even if you are just starting out as a young entrepreneur. \n",
    "\n",
    "Always strive to look your best regardless of the type of business you are in.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by making your appearance a priority and investing heavily in yourself; invest in a good wardrobe, a good hair stylist/barber and other self-care practices. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to prioritize quality over quantity. You would rather have 5 good quality handbags for example than have 20 cheap handbags that do not compliment/boost your appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also focus on Building a Good Reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might look at your age and the fact that you are starting out as a disadvantage but on the flip side, it is actually an opportunity to build a great brand from scratch and lay a good foundation for yourself and your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "I usually receive calls and meet young people (age 18-25) who usually tell me;\n",
    "\n",
    "“I want to start a business but my parents won’t allow me”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I wish to follow my passion but they told me I’m too young”\n",
    "\n",
    "These great ones usually ask, “Do you think I’m too young?”\n",
    "\n",
    "My answer to the last two who asked me that question was “You are too old”\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my advice for people who are younger than me.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, the day you discover your passion is the day you become a full grown adult (no matter how young you are).\n",
    "\n",
    "While you owe your parents respect, your life’s passion is bigger than anything/anybody, including you and your parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "At age 21 when I was going fully into the business world, I didn’t have the blessing of my lovely parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I could easily smile at my father’s anger, my mothers worry bothered me.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the woman of my life. This is the love of my life. This is the most trustworthy friend I ever had. Yet, she was crying because her son decided to follow the tough path.\n",
    "\n",
    "What should I do?\n",
    "\n",
    "I had options between pleasing my parents or following my passion.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had options between making my father proud of having a son who is working in a bank (even if that son is terribly unhappy) or making myself proud of following my gut (even though it was a tough decision).\n",
    "\n",
    "I could have made everyone else happy and sacrificed my own happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "I told myself, “I will follow my heart, even if I DIE!” (and I was actually willing to die)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my advice for everyone who is still younger than 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your passion is the only life you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your gut is far more predictable and dependable than the entire world’s suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your life  passion is bigger than you or your family members.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, it’s better for you to die at age 20, trying to follow your passion, than to live till 80 in another man’s dreams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your parents love you and that’s the reason why they don’t want you to fail. Unfortunately you have to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your brothers and sisters like you and that’s the reason why they don’t want you to die. Unfortunately you have to die before you live.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go for it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your father may disown you; go for it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The following are tips on how to do a successful business in this area of fries that will attract a good number of customers where you will rarely count on losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure you have good cooking equipment. This includes the deep frier, the potato cutter, the peelers, the ideal containers in which you will put your raw potatoes during preparation, the serving equipment such as serving scoopers, a warmer which keeps your cooked chips at the right temperature throughout and the packaging material.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You should ensure a constant supply of clean water. This will help you keep the environment within your business clean and at maximum hygienic standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Secure a reliable source of the raw materials. You can survey on the cheapest dealers of potatoes which could be the big markets that offer wholesale prices. Other materials like cooking oil, tomato sauce, chilli sauce, salt can be obtained from wholesale shops. Sometimes it is possible to make special arrangement with sellers of these commodities so as to have them delivered at your premises.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The fries must be well prepared. Too much oily fries can put off your customers very easily. This can be avoided by making sure that you give your fries enough time to cook in the hot oil to an extent of becoming slightly brown.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make sure your premises is located at a densely populated area such as near a matatu stage, within a city/town centre, within a market place or near an institution such as a school or health facility. Give a great look to your premises by doing things such as proper painting, doing graphics, tiling the floor, fitting the premises with modern furniture and adding soothing sounds such as cool music for your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Employ workers who are competent in customer care skills. They should be welcoming to the customers, must observe personal and general hygiene, must be very sensitive to the needs of the customers and they must not cause delays as they serve your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Ensure that you prepare varieties of accompanying snacks such as sausages, smokies, samosas, pies and other small bites which you are comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Before starting your business, ensure you clear with the relevant authorities such as the local authority and the public health department.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. And once you are up and running, manage your cash properly by ensuring that you give back to your business. This will ensure growth in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",

    "\n",
    "Did you know that the animal feed supply business in Kenya and Africa holds great potentials for the continent?\n",
    "\n",
    "The growing demand for meat and fish worldwide is driving up the demand for animal feeds used by livestock farmers to grow pigs, cattle, poultry, rabbit, ostrich and fish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know that most farmers often spend up to 70 percent of their costs on animal feed alone?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simon Ngugi confesses that when he ventured into the animal feeds business about four years ago he knew very little about the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, he has carved a niche in the feeds business and is making it big. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ngugi’s Nile Feeds and Cereals Limited, based in Busia County, supplies companies and farmers with the raw ingredients they need to make their own animal feeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a good week, he says that he sells up to 100 tonnes of products making about Sh.1.6 million per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ngugi’s journey into the feeds business took several turns. Initially, he wanted to be a dairy farmer in his native Nakuru County. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ngugi sits in the middle of a supply chain that connects farmers and feed manufacturers to cheap raw materials. He sources his products from Jinja, Uganda, where he argues the prices are friendlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "“At the beginning there were challenges especially in stocking as prices in Kenya were too high. This is the reason I saw it prudent to seek services from Uganda,” he says. \n",
    "\n",
    "He buys maize meal, wheat, soya and cotton cake which he then sells to clients. These products are in high demand as companies and individual farmers try to avoid the high costs associated with buying ready-made feeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "He sells his products in Mumias, Kakamega, Eldoret, Nairobi, Kiambu and Meru. Some of the companies that buy from him include Gold Farm Feeds in South Kinangop, Super Choice Feeds (Nyahururu), and Shashishi Animal Feeds (Mumias).\n",
    "\n",
    "“My first clients were farmers in my Nakuru neighbourhood. They saw how their animals thrived after feeding on my products and kept coming back,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demand for animal feeds has grown significantly and Ngugi says he plans to set up stores in Nairobi, Kiambu and Nakuru with the prospect of investing in a mill and branding his own products.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am humbled at how this establishment has grown from a simple entity to a middle range supplier with over 100 clients. With a mill I will be able to increase production tenfold and also create jobs for hundreds of youth,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major challenges entrepreneurs in the animal feeds industry face is lack of capital for expansion, he says. \n",
    "\n",
    "At Riat Centre, off Kisumu-Busia highway, Eliakim Okuku and Benjamin Makokha are busy making animal feeds at their enterprise dubbed Victoria Feeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manufacturing unit is an aluminium sheet structure, where we find two workers roasting soya beans in a metal drum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heat is intense and the workers have to keep on turning the grains with wooden stick so that they do not burn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soya beans are among the key ingredients the duo use to make animals feeds for poultry, pigs and dairy cows.\n",
    "\n",
    "It all started in 2000 when Okuku shared his idea of starting a poultry farm with his friend Makokha. While Makokha supported the idea, he had a better one of setting up a feeds processing enterprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We realized most farmers in the region had a challenge getting a steady supply of quality feeds for their birds. Some had to buy from as far as Nairobi or Nakuru,” recalls Okuku, adding that a survey they did showed feed-making materials like maize and omena were readily available locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Sh.50,000 capital, the duo bought raw materials and a locally made miller to start the business. They hired a structure for which they paid Sh.5,000 rent and went into business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having studied animal health at Kabete Training Institute, Makokha is in charge of feed formulation while Okuku, a former lab technician, doubles up as the director and salesperson.\n",
    "\n",
    "“To start an animal feeds processing enterprise, you need a permit from the county government as well as National Environment Management Authority, public health and Kenya Bureau of Standards certification,” says Okuku.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the feeds, they use ingredients such as maize germ, wheat pollard, soya beans and omena. They also source sunflower and cotton seed cake from Tanzania and Uganda.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Using the raw materials we make chick, growers, layers and Kienyeji mashes,” says Makokha, noting that the machines they have for feed processing are locally fabricated hammer miller, half-tonne mixer and stitching machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their current production is 2,000kg of animal feeds daily and have employed four people permanently and hire others on need basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "They package their feeds in 5kg, 10kg, 20kg and 50kg bags. For Kienyeji mash, 5kg goes at Sh.200, 10kg at Sh.350, 20kg at Sh.700 and 50kg at Sh.1,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chick mash, on the other hand, goes from Sh.250 to Sh.2,200 while growers mash is sold at between Sh.400 and Sh.1,750 while layers Sh.450 to Sh.2,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a good month, Okuku notes that the firm makes up to Sh.500,000 from sale of animals feeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "With agriculture being Kenya's backbone, investing in agribusiness is a profitable business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Animal feeds business is the booming business in the suburbs. Many people rely on agriculture for livelihood in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the animals reared in Kenya include cows, goats, pigs, chickens, turkeys, ducks and rabbits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Animal feeds business is a profitable venture if you can supply quality feeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Get a good business location where people rear animals and then market your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also good that you ask your customers if they like your feeds. This way, you can quickly know what changes you need to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of venturing into animal feeds making and supply business in Kenya is still a soft target that you can take on provided you are willing to put a little more effort than everyone else. \n",

    "\n",
    "Most businesses on earth exist to fix problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the natural human reaction to problems and challenges is to complain, blame, curse and criticise. \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s what many people do.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these actions enforce your rights of free expression, they hardly provide any solutions to problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "But entrepreneurs see problems differently. That’s why we are unique people. We see business opportunities in every problem. We think of solutions instead of whining about our difficulties.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because most people are frustrated by problems and challenges, they would gladly pay anyone with a solution to get it solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever had car trouble before? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are like most people, you definitely hate a car that won’t start or an ugly noise in the engine that could be the sign of something catastrophic. \n",
    "\n",
    "But you see, for a mechanic, car trouble means an opportunity to make money. Because an auto technician has the solution to your car trouble, you would gladly pay him to get it solved for good.\n",
    "\n",
    "One person’s problem is often another person’s opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you already know, our dear Africa is awash with problems. Compared to the rest of the world, Africa’s problems are very many.\n",
    "\n",
    "But while many people think this is a bad thing, I think it’s really good for us. Because, within all these problems are golden business opportunities to make money!\n",
    "\n",
    "It all depends on your perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to stop seeing problems in your life and and environment as ‘problems.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of whining, ask yourself: ‘How can I create a business from this problem?’\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly how smart entrepreneurs think in Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you really want to make money in Africa, you need to start writing a list of all the problems you have noticed and start to think of possible solutions for them.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Greenhouse farming has been practiced in Kenya for quite some time now but it’s not until recently that most Kenyans have started realizing the great benefits of practicing greenhouse farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it’s cool too. University graduates, fresh out of campus are soiling their hands in this business and they are not afraid of bragging about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it brings in the six figures. Something that would have taken them years to accomplish if they were seated behind a desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you are there seated at home unemployed, or just bored out of your mind with your current job and are looking for a great business opportunity then you are in luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me introduce to you greenhouse farming and its many benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have probably seen this greenhouse structures at one time or another but your curiosity wasn’t piqued that much, probably because you thought it was just some other ordinary farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, you are wrong. Greenhouse farming is no ordinary farming. It’s the latest ‘iPhone’ in farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here’s why\n",
    "\n",
    "*It produces a higher yield per acre*\n",
    "\n",
    "With just a small piece of land you are bound to produce more crop yield compared to outdoors farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Small greenhouses of 8 metres by 15 metres in size have been known to produce about 2,000 – 3,000 kilos of tomatoes. And going by the market price of tomatoes at Ksh.100 per kilo you are guaranteed not less than Ksh.200,000 per harvest!\n",
    "\n",
    "*It keeps pests and harsh weather at Bay*\n",
    "\n",
    "Greenhouse farming is controlled farming under a structure. This structure will protect your crops from wind, heavy rainfall, too much sunlight etc. Remember harsh weather and pests are the greatest enemies of crops.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Faster maturity*\n",
    "\n",
    "Crops cultivated under a greenhouse mature faster than the ones grown outdoors. A good example is tomatoes. Tomatoes in a greenhouse will only take 60 days to mature while the ones grown outdoors take as long as 90 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Higher shelf life for crops*\n",
    "\n",
    "Still using tomatoes as an example, you will find that tomatoes grown in a greenhouse will have a shelf life of 21 days while the ones grown outdoors will have a shelf life of 14 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have known the advantages of growing crops in a greenhouse let’s take a step further and delve into a few essential requirements needed plus the cost of setting up a greenhouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any other venture, you need to do your research well before setting up a greenhouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all you will need a bit of knowledge on greenhouse farming. Like I said earlier, this is no ordinary farming, therefore you need to approach it a bit differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily there are a few courses that you can partake. Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) has very good tutorials and courses on this. Invest a bit of your time and money to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you are going to employ some staff, then you need to teach them too. You don`t want your grand business venture being ruined by lack of basic know-how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, you need to have clear details of your farm. What’s your soil quality? How far is your farm from a water source? \n",
    "\n",
    "You wouldn’t want to start a greenhouse very far from a water source unless you have some cheap ways of transporting the water to your farm. You should also determine the quality of your soil so that you know what minerals it has and what it lacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now assume that you have details of your farm and basic knowledge of greenhouse farming and are ready to start shopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since land is scarce in Kenya, we will focus on the small greenhouse (8 metres by 15 metres)\n",
    "\n",
    "This greenhouse costs between Ksh.150,000 and Ksh.200,000 for a fully equipped one that comes together with a water tank, plastic sheet, irrigation drip lines, seeds and chemicals.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also purchase these things separately especially if you have cheaper alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crops that work better in greenhouses\n",
    "\n",
    "√ Tomatoes\n",
    "√ Cauliflower\n",
    "√ Strawberries\n",
    "√Onions\n",
    "√ Broccoli\n",
    "√ Capsicums\n",
    "e.t.c\n",
    "\n",
    "Like I had mentioned earlier, assuming you are growing tomatoes in a small green house you are bound to harvest 2,000 kilos of tomatoes in 2 months. If a kilo of tomatoes goes for Ksh.100, then you will be raking in Ksh.200,000 after every two months which translates to a whooping 1.2 million a year!\n",
    "\n",
    "Good heavens! Isn’t that great for just one green house?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the sky is the limit. You can grow your agribusiness with time and invest in more greenhouses. Which means more profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Poultry Farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have received many calls and WhatsApp messages in the past months from different Agripreneurs. \n",

    "\n",
    "“Without faith, hope and trust, there is no promise for the future and without a promising future, life has no direction, no meaning and no justification.” \n",
    "\n",
    "So never lose faith. Trust and believe it will all work out. Let your hopes not your hurts shape your future.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who never heard the 3 Nice Stories, here they go:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Story 1*: Once upon a time all villagers decided to pray for rain, on the day of the prayer all people gathered, and only one boy came with an umbrella. That’s faith. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Story 2*: When you throw a one-year-old baby in the air, he/she laughs, because he/she knows you will catch him/her. That’s trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Story 3*: Every night we go to bed, we have no assurance to wake up alive the next morning, yet we set the alarm for the morning. That’s hope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good times do not last forever, but so do bad times. They do not last forever or for that matter of fact, they don’t even last for too long. \n",
    "\n",
    "But those moments sound and feel like moments of disaster, doom and defeat and we experience emotions of frustration, anger, depression and much more. And in those moments and emotions, we tend to make more mistakes than ever and complicate our situations further.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, are there simpler ways to get over tough times? May be, may be not depending on how you look at it and how you react to the situation you are in. Have faith in your own self and your ability, trust good things can and will eventually happen and hope for the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, having said that, there are other things that you can do too.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Accept the person or the situation*\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding is Acceptance. Only with acceptance comes recovery. The best thing one can do when it’s raining is to Let it rain. Accept what is, let go of what was and have faith in what will be. If you are in a certain situation, it is because of either a person or a situation. When you hold that thought or grudge, you do not move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "That feeling of resentment can only take you backward. So the best thing to do in an unsavory situation is to accept the person or the situation. As they say, when you deny or ignore, you delay; when you accept & face, you can only conquer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Focus on what you can control*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not be able to control every situation and its outcome, but you can control your attitude and how you deal with it. If you spend your time and energies on trying to focus on what you cannot control, you are going to be more frustrated than ever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, when caught up in a tough situation, operate from your position of strength and not your position of weakness. Control the things you can control and have faith that good things will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Inhale positivity and exhale negativity*\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative thinker sees a difficulty in every opportunity and a positive thinker sees an opportunity in every difficulty. It is up to you where you want to be. No matter where you want to be or where you are headed to, you are bound to be challenged by challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "So despite where situations or people (including yourself) land you in, stop holding to what hurts and make room for what feels good. Never forget how blessed you are. Don’t be negative when you have so much to be positive about.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Follow your heart*\n",
    "\n",
    "There is wisdom in following your heart, because if you always follow your mind, you will always act on logic and logic does not always lead to happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is important sometimes to trust the wisdom of your heart & your soul. That is why there is merit in trusting your intuition. You don’t need to explain or justify your feelings to anyone, just trust your own inner guidance, your heart and you can be rest assured to reach the right path.\n",
    "\n",
    "So stop thinking too much and complicating your life, trust your dreams, your heart and your story.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get Creative*\n",
    "\n",
    "Creativity is just connecting things, connecting the dots. It is seeing what everyone else has seen, and thinking what no one else has thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when life throws challenges at you, you just need to think creatively and what you can create with the challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn problems into opportunities, of course it is not easy, but so is nothing in life. Life as they say, is a continuous exercise in creative problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Show Gratitude & Forgive*\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are thankful for what you have, you are always rewarded with more. Try to stay positive and things will get better. Holding grudge against people or situations, can only make you bitter, not strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forgiving on the other hand does not make you weak, it sets you free. The first to apologize is the bravest. The first to forgive is the strongest and the first to forget is the happiest. So you choose what you want in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Life goes on, whether you choose to move on and take a chance in the unknown, or stay behind, locked in the past and thinking of what you could have done is a choice you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have Faith, Trust & Hope and move on. People change, things go wrong but remember life goes on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infact, when a train goes through a tunnel and its gets dark, you do not throw the ticket and jump off. You sit still and trust that you are going to come out. Similarly, when you are struck in terrible situations, “Trust that no matter how dark your situation is, you will come out.”\n",

    "\n",
    "The bike rental business is becoming a new trend in Kenya. Riding is a hobby for many people. Many bikers want to avoid the cost of buying one, hence opting to hire one. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bicycle hiring business is a new trend in universities and along the coastal regions and especially the beach. \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a bike rental business is a profitable venture. You can also train people how to ride a bike at a fee. \n",
    "\n",
    "While other university students keep pressuring their parents with rent, school fees and pocket money, some students from different campuses have recently started up a bicycle hiring business to help raise their personal upkeep money and school fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arry Ochieng’- Moi University, Collins Oduor- Moi University, Ian Ogenga- JKUAT and Kevin Ochieng Kisumu Polytechnic who have been friends since their primary school days used their personal savings to raise the business capital that was around Sh.130,000 which was used to purchase the first 13 bicycle each going for Sh.10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their target market being Maseno University students, the quartet is receiving customers both from the University and the neighboring community where apparently they all grew up in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any other business, the bike business has its peak season and the low season.\n",
    "\n",
    "“As much as we spent a lot to start the business I feel it’s catching up and the returns are so good. Unlike the weekends where we get around Sh.6,000 daily income, weekdays are a bit tricky because the students are busy with classes but we still make around Sh.2,000 to Sh.3,000,” said Arry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bikes that go for Sh.2 per minute are hired by students for various reasons. Some to just have fun riding, some for exercise purposes while some get the bicycles in order to rush to classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we are going to show you how to start a bike rental business in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Write Bike Rental Business Plan*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting a bike rental business in Kenya, it is important that you first write a business plan. A business plan helps you plan ahead and prepare before launching your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the things you need to capture in your bicycle rental business plan include: \n",
    "\n",
    "*Startup costs \n",
    "\n",
    "*Business location \n",
    "\n",
    "*Competitor analysis of other bike rental companies \n",
    "\n",
    "*Where to source bicycles at lower prices \n",
    "\n",
    "*Bicycle prices in Kenya \n",
    "\n",
    "…And much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Identify a Good Location for a Bike Rental Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "The bike rental business thrives well in areas with a young population. Some of the best places to start the bike rental business include near universities, colleges and near recreational areas like beaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also start one in public places like near hotels or social places like gardens where people come to take a rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cost of Starting a Bicycle Hiring Business in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of starting a bike hiring business depends on the number of bikes you wish to start with. Bikes are not expensive to buy and maintain. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good mountain bike goes for around Ksh.15,000. You can start with two bicycles and buy more as the demand increases. This means you can start with two bike for Ksh.30,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may want also to budget for the cost of maintaining the bikes. Bike repairs are very cheap and it would cost you less than Ksh.2,000 for each bike a month.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Is Bike Rental Business Profitable in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The bike rental business is fairly a new business and its market is not saturated. It means when you start the business, you won’t face much competition. It means that you can set prices depending on the demand for bike services.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, it costs Ksh.100 to rent a bike per hour. If you have two bikes and each gets hired for 5 hours in a day, you will have made Ksh.1,000. It is a good business that you can combine with other businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also offer other services like training services at a fee. This will help you boost your revenues and get more customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Challenges in the Bike Rental Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "The bike rental business is a lucrative venture, but it also has its challenges. Some of the challenges include the risk of losing your bikes to thieves. You need to come up with measures to mitigate such risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways to avoid such risks is to ensure that those who come to rent your bikes present an ID card. Cross-check that the person renting the bike is the person on the ID. Retain the ID card while they ride and return it to them when they return your bicycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "The bike rental business is a great way to make an extra income if you have a bike you are not using. You can also team up with a friend to launch a large bike rental business. \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate significant revenues from this business, you need to have a good number of bikes and mainly target the young population in densely populated areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we always tell you, there’s no marathon race that has ever been won by those who did not start the race. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you like the idea discussed above and you have what it takes to actualize it… then don’t wait to start… just do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Poultry Farming.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Most people need to be motivated before they buy a product or service.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best ways to create desire for your product is to sell the benefits and results. People want to know what they will get or enjoy by spending their money on your product.\n",
    "\n",
    "One great example: \n",
    "\n",
    "Mariam is 30 kilograms overweight. She has been making plans to join a gym or start a weight loss program that will make her lose weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is, she’s been planning for five years now and still hasn’t done anything about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "She has a desperate need for a solution but is too busy to do any research to find one that’s right for her. \n",
    "\n",
    "She can afford a gym membership but she’s too lazy to find one that’s close to her house or office.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think would happen if I walked up to Miriam and told her that I have a proven formula that will make her lose her excess weight in just three months?\n",
    "\n",
    "What if I went ahead to show her ‘before’ and ‘after’ pictures of my previous clients who reached their target weights using my formula? \n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the price is right for her, Miriam would buy my product immediately! \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, after five years of delay, she would buy my product because I did something differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "And what exactly did I do differently? \n",
    "\n",
    "I created a desire for my product. By selling the benefits and results of using my product, I created a desire in Miriam that allowed her to make a quick decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many entrepreneurs don’t do a good job of letting customers know the benefits of using their products and services. \n",
    "\n",
    "People need to know that your product/service is better, cheaper, faster, safer, more effective etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two of the best ways I know to use desire to sell more of your products and services:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Always sell the benefits first* \n",
    "\n",
    "Customers are selfish; they are always thinking about themselves and how your product or service will work for them. \n",
    "\n",
    "They don’t really care about the name of your product or the features that it has, customers are more interested in benefits and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an entrepreneur, you need to get into the habit of selling the benefits of your products and services first before anything else. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than telling a potential customer that you run a laundry service, tell them: “I wash dirty laundry and return them in less than 36 hours at a very affordable price.” \n",
    "\n",
    "*Be specific*\n",
    "\n",
    "The more specific you are about the benefits and results your products can deliver, the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "By providing an idea of the value a customer will get from your products, you show that you are for real and know what you are talking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your product or service saves time, give an estimate of how much time it saves. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it’s cheaper than other products in the market, it’s a good idea to mention the amount of money the customer could save by using your product. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s always better to get specific with the benefits and results of your products.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "Advertise benefit or solution, not your products/services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who actually cares about what you are selling? You and some of your employees. Nobody else does. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why consumers want to buy a particular product or service is because it solves their problem or because buying it benefits them in a certain way(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "For your marketing message to be persuasive, it must not talk about what you are selling. It must talk about how what you are offering will make people`s life better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always remember: Don`t advertise what you are selling. Nobody cares about it. Advertise the benefit consumers will derive from buying your products/services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Poultry Farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have received many calls and WhatsApp messages in the past months from different Agripreneurs. \n",

    " \n",
    "Whenever Fredrick Makokha visited his late mother, Penninah Aswani, she would prepare for him chicken stew accompanied with ugali. That was until her passing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To keep her memory alive, Makokha decided to rear chicken at his backyard so that he would have enough birds to feed his family and sell others. \n",
    " \n",
    "Makokha, who hails from Maondo village, Eshiyunzu location in Kakamega Central Sub County, bought one-month-old 50 indigenous chickens and started rearing them. But after three months, he had slaughtered all of them.\n",
    " \n",
    "Later on, his wife, persuaded him to fully venture into poultry farming. As a result he bought 600 rainbow rooster day-old chicks, from a friend in Eldoret. \n",
    "\n",
    "A month later, he bought another 600 chicks from the same supplier. \n",
    "\n",
    "He named his venture, Pen Chick Poultry Farm in memory of his mother. \n",
    " \n",
    "“I converted my mother’s house into a poultry house. I also erected more structures in the compound to accommodate all birds.”\n",
    " \n",
    "After the chicks turned seven days old, he administered gumboro vaccine, and re-administered the Newcastle vaccine after three weeks following an initial vaccination to the day-old chicks. \n",
    "\n",
    "At four weeks, he vaccinated them against bronchitis. The 1,200 chicks were bought at Sh.100 each.\n",
    " \n",
    "For the first 14 days, he fed the chicks on at least 13 grams each of chick starter since it’s rich in proteins and vitamins that enable them grow at a faster rate and for strength. \n",
    "\n",
    "After 14 days, he fed them on 18 grams of chick mash and 120grams each chick mash once they turn two months.\n",
    " \n",
    "He also gave the day-old chicks liquid paraffin - not the normal paraffin - to help in clearing and softening the digestive system in preparation for feed ingestion. As it is a laxative, it also prevents constipation which leads to death in small chicks as they are not used to digesting solids.\n",
    " \n",
    "In administering the liquid paraffin, he drops about 2 drops, but not more than 5 drops, in 20 litres of water. Since the liquid paraffin is not soluble in water, it will spread to form a thin film, and the chicks will consume it as they take the water.\n",
    " \n",
    "“After one week, I changed the feeds to chick mash which I fed them for two months and then started introducing growers’ mash in small portions. They fed on growers’ mash for another 12 weeks until we started seeing the first eggs five months later, after which we changed feeds to layers’ mash,” said Mr Makokha.\n",
    " \n",
    "He also feeds them with sukuma wiki, amaranth and cabbages for yellow pigmentation in the egg yolk and to add taste to the birds reared for meat.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Water*\n",
    " \n",
    "“Chicks should take warm water to reduce mortality caused by pneumonia,” said Lilian Ayuma, Makokha’s wife. \n",
    "\n",
    "Birds are made up of 65 per cent of water which is ideal for their metabolism, adding that water controls their body temperature, the rate of food they digest and their body waste. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each bird should consume at least 0.5 litres a day.\n",
    " \n",
    "“If your birds don’t have access to supply of fresh and clean water, they will stop laying eggs for several days. Chickens without water won’t have much of an appetite so they won’t grow as big especially if you are rearing them for meat”.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Sales*\n",
    " \n",
    "On a good day, he collects between 800 and 1,500 eggs which are already fertilized and sells each at Sh.20 and a tray at Sh.600.\n",
    " \n",
    "“The money from selling eggs enabled me to buy an incubator with a capacity of 1,056 eggs at Sh.90,000. I now hatch my own chicks and sell them in Bungoma, Busia, Kisumu and Vihiga,” said Makokha.\n",
    " \n",
    "In the past five months, he has collected 135,000 eggs. Quick math shows that at a cost of Sh.20 per fertilized egg, he has made Sh.2.7 million in sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "“Poultry business is lucrative compared to being a CEO of a company,” he says.\n",
    " \n",
    "“A one-day-old chick retails at Sh.100, a 2-week-old at Sh.150, a four-week-old at Sh.250 and a two-month-old at Sh.450. I am now able to fend for my family and pay school fees. My stock has risen to 3,000 birds and by the end of this year, I will be having between 6,000 and 10,000 birds.” \n",
    " \n",
    "“An 8-month cock which serves between 5 to 8 birds is sold at Sh.1,500 and a hen at Sh.900.”\n",
    "\n",
    "We have received many calls and WhatsApp messages in the past months from different Agripreneurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these people (unfortunately) called us after they had already made some serious mistakes and there was nothing or little we could do to help them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have met so many Kenyans making mistakes in poultry farming business and losing their money. \n",
    "\n",
    "How can people work hard (for 5 to 10 years) to save money, then put the money into a business, only to make mistakes and lose it all? \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s painful and I don’t want it to happen to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the reason why we have organized for a Poultry Farming Training to educate you and to help you with our years of experience in business and poultry farming world. \n",

    "I have been watching the behavior of our Kenyan youths on T.V during this campaigning season and I feel sorry for the Kenyan youths.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s fire on the mountain. Something needs to be done to arrest this astronomical increase in the number of wasted youths we are witnessing in our present day.\n",

    "\n",
    "Well, a wasted youth...\n",
    "\n",
    "*Readily follows bandwagon*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably because following bandwagon is easier. A wasted youth is incapable of having original thought or opinion of his own so you don’t expect him to do anything else except follow popular opinion—even ridiculously insane opinions!\n",
    "\n",
    "Has no idea of his or her purpose in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wasted youth has no plans for his future. He would rather rely on what his parents, friends, employers, pastors, cult leaders, politicians, etc., tells him will favor him.\n",
    "\n",
    "But do you really blame him? Because a wasted youth has no purpose for life, he is bound to be a confused being.\n",
    "\n",
    "And who is the easiest person to push around if not a confused person!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hardly reads*\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, he/she does not read. This is one of the easiest ways to spot a wasted youth. Apart from reading his Facebook, Instagram or twitter updates and maybe his school textbooks, that is where his reading stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial books, Personal growth books, journals, business idea and advice articles, even current affairs is not really his thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, he will proudly and openly tell you he doesn’t have time for any of that!\n",
    "\n",
    "Listen to this. If you are suspecting any youth in your vicinity to be a wasted youth, just ask him or her to tell you the last financial or personal growth book he actually read and when he read it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t be surprised to find out that some of them have not read any literature in the past ten years!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now tell me, how will such a person’s mind grow or develop!?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Thinks certificate is education*\n",
    "\n",
    "A wasted youth will never fail to remind you that he or she is educated and has a certificate. He will be quick to tell you that he is a first class honors, a 2.1, a 2.2, a master’s degree holder e.t.c.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I’m like, and so?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone can get a certificate these days. Coupled with the fact that there are so many degree awarding tertiary institutions these days spread everywhere across the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our today’s evolving world, your certificate doesn’t count for much nowadays. \n",
    "\n",
    "What I want you to know and start pondering upon is this: what can I do with the knowledge this certificate I am holding represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Prefers having a job to having a career or owning a business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell a wasted youth you started your own business, he/she will tell you congrats in a very lukewarm manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "But tell him/her you finally got that job, and watch as he/she will exclaim and rejoice for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "The job mentality of most of our wasted youths can be killing at times. It doesn’t even matter to them the nature of the job or whether you will be fulfilling your career goals in that very job or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as you tell him/her that you will receive a salary at the end of the month, they will rejoice.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is very vain*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, vain as in primarily concerned with things like sex, fashion, football, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok...\n",
    "\n",
    "You know you won’t catch his interest by talking about good financial books. Try talking about sex and he will suddenly come alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see it every day on social media. Make an intelligent post or ask an intellectually stimulating question on social media. It will just be as if most of these wasted youths will see it but just jump and pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone is talking about a business book or a business idea; only few people respond. But now, let’s make the topic to be something related to sex. Oh yeah! Now you are talking! Come see traffic! Come see responses...\n",
    "\n",
    "These youths are so interested in knowing who is having sex with who, which celeb is 'doing' another celeb, which celeb is sharing her nude image on Instagram, the latest sex positions or styles, the latest sex scandals, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Funny isn’t it?\n",
    "\n",
    "A wasted youth is a confused youth!\n",
    "\n",
    "But it’s not only sex that easily catches his/her attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some of them, they like talking about money but not in the sense a reasonable person will talk about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truth is that a wasted youth will like to discuss about how much football stars, movie icons and music stars are making. \n",
    "\n",
    "He will waste time to calculate for you the worth of most of these stars, or how much their jewels, mansions and cars all cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some wasted youths even take it too far by going into drugs. Isn’t it amazing the number of our youths—both males and females—who are now into smoking bhang and drinking alcohol these days? \n",

    "Take John (not his real name). He was a casual worker in Nairobi when he got his share of the family land. \n",
    "\n",
    "He would usually trek to Industrial Area to look for odd jobs, barely making ends meet.\n",
    "\n",
    "One day, an idea hit him: Why not sell a portion of his ancestral land in rural Kenya and buy a plot in Nairobi? \n",
    "\n",
    "He would then develop the plot and start earning rent – as a newly-minted landlord. \n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, yes! Why not? After all, that was his land.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some members of his family sneered and jeered at him. They reproached him. Others warned him he would remain cursed forever, an outcast.\n",
    "\n",
    "What sensible man sells his inheritance and risks the resultant fortune? \n",
    "\n",
    "They wondered aloud. Would John be a repeat of the Biblical fable of the Prodigal Son who sold off his entire inheritance and fled home to seek worldly pleasures that ultimately consumed all his newfound riches?\n",
    "\n",
    "Undeterred, John forged on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have seen the steely determination on his face! No matter what, he would not budge. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should have then seen the broad smile that illuminated his face when the buyer paid cash for the five acres.\n",
    "\n",
    "An overjoyed John returned to Nairobi and bought his plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "He built 20 neat rooms, dug a borehole in the compound and started raking in a monthly rent of Ksh.5,000 per room from happy tenants. That was a cool Ksh.100,000 per month! A fortune!\n",
    "\n",
    "The former casual worker quit Industrial Area and devoted his time to keeping his beloved plot sparkling clean. He took good care of it – really gave it tender loving care. The rent kept flowing in every month (and still does).\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think happened next?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not believe this. After four years, the man who had bought John’s ancestral land decided to sell it. He wanted to relocate to another part of Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "John heard this and offered to buy back that land. He bought it together with the house the previous owner had built there.\n",
    "\n",
    "In four short years, his fortunes had changed. He had regained his ancestral land and owned a 20-room house in Nairobi. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine how embarrassed his family members were. They shut their mouths. \n",
    "\n",
    "John was now a landlord. He was also the proud owner of the 10 acres he had inherited – all intact. Talk of a man having his cake and eating it too, and you would be referring to John.\n",
    "\n",
    "Was he lucky? Maybe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Was he a risk-taker? Definitely!\n",
    "\n",
    "One person who would probably applaud John’s approach is Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The American entrepreneur, visionary and philanthropist made a profound statement on risk-taking when still in his 20s. \n",
    "\n",
    "He said: “The biggest risk is not taking any risk.” And added: “In a world that’s changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.”\n",
    "\n",
    "John took a risk. And the risk paid off handsomely.\n",
    "\n",
    "More than half-a-century ago, American president John F. Kennedy noted: “There are risks and costs to action. But they are far less than the long-range risks of comfortable inaction.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that last word: inaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another American leader, George S. Patton, a general of the United States Army, gave similar advice: “Take calculated risks. That is quite different from being rash.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Investing in real estate, just like John did, involves taking calculated risks in pursuit of great benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Risks are a part of everyday life. In fact, everything you do is a risk in one way or another. For example when you go to school you risk failing in your exams. When you marry you risk divorce.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are alive you risk dying. When you go to sleep, you risk not waking up the next morning to go to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, appreciate the fact that you have to take risks if you want to succeed in life… and start taking risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a quote that goes: “A person who risks nothing does nothing, has nothing and dies with nothing” – Leo F.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, nothing good comes in a comfort zone. Get out there and take calculated risks.\n",

    "Without wasting much time, let us focus on these mistakes and how you can rise above them to establish a McDonald’s of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Underestimating the Cost of Setting Up*\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you are planning to start a small kibanda somewhere in a dark corner of the country, a serious restaurant business requires one to invest generously. For instance you need to budget for:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Equipment:* Ksh.120,000 (Sufurias, utensils, gas cylinders, juice blenders, microwave, refrigerator etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Restaurant Licenses*: Ksh.50,000 (Single business permit, food & hygiene license, food handler’s certificate, fire certificate and environment certificate).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Set Up Cost*: Ksh.350,000 (furniture, lighting, interior décor, wash-room equipment, cleaning equipment)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Supplies*: You will also need to budget for basic supplies such as Charcoal, grocery, cooking oil, flour, rice, sugar, salt, potatoes, milk to start with. Total cost Ksh.30,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Rent*: Unless you have your own premises, then you need to budget for at least Ksh.30,000 per month to rent a large hall near a street with high human traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are planning to set up in the Central Business District (CBD) of a big city like Mombasa or Nairobi, then this cost may scale to a high of Ksh.100,000 per month or even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Goodwill*: Goodwill is a fee that landlords charge arising from the reputation that a premises has built over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance a landlord with an office-to-let along Kenyatta Avenue will tend to charge more goodwill than one along River-Road because of reputation and types of customers who use the latter street instead of the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all landlords charge this fee. But if you’re planning to set up your restaurant in the CBD, then better be prepared to pay a Goodwill of at least 1 million shillings or as high as Ksh.20 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add all that cost and you will see that a small restaurant in an urban will require at least Ksh.500,000 to start and sustain. More money will be needed to keep it going as you work hard to build a clientele.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Expecting To Break-Even In Less Than 6 Months*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most businesses require at least 24 months to break-even and restaurant business is no different. The first year of operation is a time to make many mistakes and the second year is a time to recover from the impact of those mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t be fooled that you can start making big money in a few months. Patience is a virtue that every restaurant owner should learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Starting Big, Milking It Dry and Dying Small*\n",
    "\n",
    "90% eateries start off quite well. The food tastes great, the smiles welcoming the customer are wide and the décor is in tip-top condition. However, just 6 months down the line, the services begin to deteriorate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The taste that welcomed you fades away, prices climb, portion sizes start to shrink and the staff look sullen. The once impeccable décor slowly crumbles under the weight of under-investment. Eventually, the restaurant is milked dry and it bites the dust!\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s a very common story in the Kenyan restaurant industry. Don’t be yet another victim of starting big and dying small. It’s far wiser to start small and grow gradually by investing more in great services, outside catering, well-trained staff and decor.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Treating Chef and Serving Staff to Peanuts*\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a stunning location, great customers and wonderful suppliers but then you resort to hiring under-trained workers so you can underpay them and save a few more cents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that’s equivalent to digging your own grave. Restaurant business, like any other service business, is highly sensitive to small changes in quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The moment you choose to compromise marks the beginning of your slow death. Moreover, underpayment of staff only increases chances of pilferage and negligence at the workplace – and this as you know means no good either.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to start a successful restaurant you need three things (1) A great chef (2) A great location (3) A great concept. Always over-estimate your capital needs and be ready to evolve to suit changing market environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, don’t be too cheap or too expensive – find a good working balance and abide by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Poultry Farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called *POULTRY FARMING TRAINING* \n",

    "28/05/2022, 8:33 pm - +254 754 839228: *IS FISH BUSINESS PROFITABLE IN KENYA?*\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an existing mentality that the only people who can benefit from the fish business are people living in Kisumu County. \n",
    "\n",
    "I might not be a fishmonger, but hearing a monger’s point of view can really sharpen your mindset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smoke curls from the wooden shed as sizzling hot oil in the deep-frying pan quickly turns the red white reddish fish into an inviting, golden brown delicacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers munch the delicacy sitting at the lone form inside the shed while others stand outside waiting for the trader to wrap up their purchase so that they can enjoy it at their homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shed near Kutus market “Mjini” is owned by an entrepreneurial young man, Isaak Kinyua who spotted a lucrative opportunity in whetting the appetites for fish for the residents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through hard and smart work, Kinyua has cut a niche for himself as a fish dealer of choice for many people who visit the market and want to take a bite of fish.\n",
    "\n",
    "He has customers who make orders for him to deliver the large catches to their homesteads.\n",
    "\n",
    "He deals in mud fish, common cap and eels varieties that he sources from Masinga dam on the border of Embu and Machakos counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early every day, Kinyua rides in his motorcycle to Masinga dam through the Piai (Makutano) route. Around 11am, he has bought fish for the day from fishermen and rides back to Kutus to start selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I buy only live fish and hire people to slaughter them for me as I watch. I can’t risk buying an already slaughtered fish as it can spoil my business should it go bad,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinyua reveals that traders compete to buy the large sized fish, which appeal to moneyed customers. He also buys several, small sized ones to meet the needs of all his customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Masinga dam where men spend the night fishing in their canoes and row to the shore in the morning, traders buy a kilogram at Sh.250.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the trader and fishermen “eye” the catch and come to a mutual agreement on its price depending on its size. Kinyua prefers the second arrangement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once back at his joint, its sheer hard work as he hangs the fish from the large window. He then embarks on deep frying and selling the fish and serving customers until he sells the last fish.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t keep the fish overnight. I only buy what I am able to sell for the day. I buy and sell a bucketful of fish every day,” says the trader.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinyua does not regret leaving his job where he earned Sh.25,000 monthly for self-employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, he is a happy he is own boss and makes more than double that amount. He started the fish eatery last year after several pitfalls in employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinyua narrates that in his first job at Kutus market, he was employed to sell mitumba clothes. He saved every coin and enrolled for a driving course. He also upgraded his wardrobe but that did not go well with his employer and he was fired.\n",
    "\n",
    "After hustling for a while, he got a job as a driver and would frequently drive his boss to Nairobi.\n",
    "\n",
    "“On our journeys back, we would stop at Sagana to buy fish. He would send me to buy. I interacted with the fish mongers and developed an interest in what they did,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coincidentally at that time, a friend had been requesting Kinyua for connection to a job. Kinyua thus resolved to open a fish joint and have his friend operate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The friend was a university student and I would pay him Sh.400 every day. Whereas my salary as a driver would be delayed, I was paying him without fail. That only hastened my resolve to quit employment,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once he quit his job and was fully into the fish business, Kinyua was concerned that transportation cost ate heavily into his profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To source for fish, he was hiring a motorcycle and a rider at Sh.800 and fueling it with about Sh.500 every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "When he bought his own motorcycle, he bypassed that expense and is now able to cover longer distances to get best fish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinyua says his business is profitable especially now that he has loyal clientele. He makes a profit of about Sh.300 per kilogram. He sells the big fish at around Sh.1,500 but the few gigantic ones can fetch as much as Sh.3,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we were talking about his business, Kinyua received several calls from police officers, a teacher, a pastor and business people who form his customers who make orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "He faces the challenge of stiff competition but is able to withstand it by offering services of the highest quality. In fact, his shed does not have the characteristic fishy smell of some fish eateries.\n",
    "\n",
    "He frequently wipes his working bench to keep off flies. Satisfied customers of his fish refer others to him.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally;* \n",
    "\n",
    "I hope Kinyua`s business success story has been an inspiration to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes in our daily activities and professional/employment work we come across business ideas that can change our financial life but we are blind, we don`t see this ideas. Or if we see them, we are lazy in implementing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article should inspire you to open your eyes and mind to various profitable business opportunities that surround your daily activities.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes back, I had the pleasure of having one of my business friends visiting me with his 9 years old son (Brighton).\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend asked his son as they were in my office, “What do you think Uncle Justine is doing here?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I can’t remember the young boy’s response but that question pushed him to come near me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I started “brainwashing” him.\n",
    "\n",
    "What! In front of his dad?\n",
    "\n",
    "His dad actually does that always (so I’m only helping him).\n",
    "\n",
    "I started telling the boy, “You see, this is my company. When you grow up, what you have to do is to build a company like this where you will employ people”\n",
    "\n",
    "In the evening as we were in a restaurant, we asked the 9 years old boy, “What do you think is happening here?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a good student, Brighton acclaimed, “This is a company”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Good! Can you see the owner of this company working here?” his dad asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "“No!” Brighton answered.\n",
    "\n",
    "“When you grow up, build businesses and employ people to work there. Right?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yes!” Brighton nodded his head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you like it or not, what we were doing is brainwashing the young boy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were simply trying to “turn his brain to where we want it to go”\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t tell me this is good or bad. Just agree with me that every parent does that.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we were growing up, our teachers told us, “If you pass your exams and graduate with good grades, you will work for a good company and earn a good salary”\n",
    "\n",
    "Our parents and elders always told us the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "What they were doing was simply turning our brain to where they wanted.\n",

    "\n",
    "So, you want to invest in UBER – the famous taxi-hailing service that has brought a mountain of digital disruption to the traditional taxi business. \n",
    "\n",
    "How profitable is it from a business perspective? \n",
    "\n",
    "Do the numbers add up? \n",
    "\n",
    "What’s the future like for this Uber in Kenya and Africa in general? \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Uber Operates*\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if you really don’t have an idea what this Uber thing is all about then perhaps it’s important we tell you the ABCD of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uber is an online service just like Facebook or Whatsapp. But to be specific while Facebook focuses on bringing the society together and Whatsapp focuses on chat services, Uber primarily focuses on bringing taxi drivers and taxi customers together.\n",
    "\n",
    "People seeking to hire a taxi to move from place A to B simply log onto Uber and look for the most convenient taxi available. \n",
    "\n",
    "They then simply send the taxi driver a request. This simplifies things for everyone. The taxi guy gets customers easily while the customer gets the service conveniently at the touch of a button.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Let’s Talk Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone can join Uber and take advantage of its popularity to make some money. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing you have to do is make sure you have a good vehicle (currently they are taking vehicles manufactured from 2009 onwards).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are admitted as a driver, customers will easily find you – and the more business you do the better your profile becomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Customers will be rating your services with stars. The more stars you get, the more trustworthy and marketable you become.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much Money Can I Make With Uber In Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The taxi hailing service’s pricing guidelines are as follows (keep in mind that this prices came about after the previous offerings were revised down by 35%).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ksh.35 per Kilometre\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ksh.3 per minute\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ksh.100 Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ksh.200 Cancellation Fine\n",
    "\n",
    "For every customer you carry, Uber will take 25 per cent of the money you make… you keep the remaining 75 per cent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the more trips you make per day, the more you can make. The more customer requests you cancel, the more you lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Per Day Earnings (Estimates)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Having talked to a number of Uber drivers in Nairobi, we were able to get a rough idea of how much they make per day. \n",
    "\n",
    "One driver complained that there were too many Uber taxis and that the business had gone down significantly. He told us that on a bad day he gets at least 10 requests making at least Ksh.2,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another driver said that he makes at least Ksh.100,000 per month with his Toyota Belta car but added that he was worried about the proposed Value Added Tax V.A.T charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Verdict*\n",
    "\n",
    "To join or not to join Uber? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that decision is entirely up to you. But while at it, it’s worth noting that every business has its own fare share of challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the recent reduction in per-trip charges, rising competition and worries about who should shoulder the burden of V.A.T the venture may prove less attractive to car owners who buy cars on loan and hire drivers to do the job for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s however not to say that the business is unprofitable. NO. If you can drive the car yourself, and maintain good client relations, you can make a decent living out of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if you can afford to invest in a large fleet of cars, then you can take advantage of economies of scale to operate profitably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Poultry Farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "We only have 1 day remaining before we start our Poultry Farming Training.\n",

    "\n",
    "“Life is too expensive” \n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s a hopeless scenario out here” \n",
    "\n",
    "“I will never get out of debt” \n",
    "\n",
    "“Were it not for my parents I would have done better in this life”\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever found yourself making such utterances? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, be my guest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever way you look at it, there is always someone who we can all blame for our woes – whether in business or in life in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "But as it turns out, blaming just compounds the problem instead of solving it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the cycle goes… the hustlers blame the banks for not making loans affordable enough for start-ups. The banks blame the government for collecting too many taxes making it difficult for them to operate profitably. Then the government blames the hustlers and banks for not paying adequate taxes hence inhibiting normal service-delivery. \n",
    "\n",
    "The politicians blame everyone else apart from themselves of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isn’t that how we live on this side of the planet? \n",
    "\n",
    "The cycle of blame is what dominates our lives which is why we have little time to focus on things that actually matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The world’s most successful people don’t take excuses. Instead, they create solutions to problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "They don’t spend the whole day complaining on social media and expect things to change as if by way of a miracle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, they sit down and create solutions that transforms the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "And that’s why we have things like M-Pesa, Virgin Money, Bitcoins, Uber, SmartPhones and even cars around us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peasants on the other hand are known to complain. They blame the government for not building enough schools. They expect to be given free things. \n",
    "\n",
    "They operate for most of their lives feeling like someone owes them an apology for their troubles. And that’s why to-date we have slums popping up everywhere, heightened political tension, loss of human values, environmental degradation among other evils that are associated with lack of commitment to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mahatma Gandhi once said – Be the change you want to see in the world. In other words, in order for our lives to change for the better, we should all change our attitude towards life and do less BLAMING and take responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you really want to move ahead in life, you must stop feeling like everyone else owes you an apology for your current state of affairs and start committing to bringing solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are planning to get started in business, stop blaming lack of capital for your woes – just do what you can with what you have. \n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, if you want to scale-up your business into a medium-sized business – it’s time you stop blaming the government and state of economy and focus on simple, creative solutions that can enhance your growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich-minded people take time to SEARCH for problems they could solve.\n",

    "Poor-minded people take their time to search for problems they can complain about.\n",

    "\n",
    "*1. Personal development*\n",

    "\n",
    "*How to become a motivational speaker*\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Sharpen your public speaking skills*\n",

    "Social media platforms are an effective marketing tool every motivational speaker should have. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you apply for a gig, chances are very high that whoever is potentially giving you a job will check you online. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Getting Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of being a motivational speaker is you do not need hundreds of thousands to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "The major capital you need to invest in is yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Start by identifying your area of expertise depending on your back ground, interest and expertise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some places that are most receptive to motivational speakers are;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Schools (primary, high school and university)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Corporates\n",
    "\n",
    "*Churches, etc\n",
    "\n",

    "*Build your Brand*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every professional needs to intentionally build a reputable personal brand. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, motivational speakers should take their brand seriously since that is what will sell you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start building your personal brand, take time to think about who you are, what you have achieved and how you want others to see you.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Set a Speaking Fee Rate*\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining what your speaking fee should be can be so stressful especially because when starting out, you may have to do some speaking engagements for free. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some important questions to ask yourself before choosing a speaking fee rate;\n",
    "\n",
    "Will travel expenses be included? What will be the mode of transport?\n",
    "\n",
    "What audience am I speaking to? Speaking to experienced professionals for example will definitely cost more than a speaking engagement with high school students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is accommodation covered? As a motivational speaker, you have to travel a lot. Set your accommodation standards from the beginning and don’t accept anything that is not decent.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s the audience size?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever you do, make sure you do not work for free for too long and don’t underprice yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the more times you speak, the better you get, the more you should charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are an author or have DVD’s of your talks, you can sell them during the events.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get Registered*\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have everything ready, register your company and get the relevant licenses. \n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to get certified by the National Industrial Training Authority (NITA) to have an edge in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you venture into motivational speaking as a business?\n",
    "\n",
    "I leave that for you to decide.\n",

    "\n",
    "Today, on 1st June, we are celebrating another independence day of our dear country Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people will say there is nothing for us to celebrate. Others will say we are worse today than we were 50 years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don`t have time for such argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, I want us to examine few facts about Kenya's independence and see some things we can learn as business owners and people who want to be successful in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I will be discussing with you six lessons you (and I) can learn from how our great fathers fought for the freedom of our country, Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Freedom is not free*\n",
    "\n",
    "Today when you see someone who is financially independent, what do you think?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see someone who has achieved something, what do you think about their achievements?\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think about Kenya's independence?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Freedom is not free._\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of our forefathers had to fight with their lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "They had to take great risks of confronting the Britains who were our colonial masters. It was not a joke. It was a fight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear friend, what do you want for your life?\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial independence or any other independence?\n",
    "\n",
    "You won`t get your “independence” easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Freedom is not free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make up your mind to “fight” for whatever you desire in your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "By “fight”, I mean, be determined. Be strong. Be willing to pay the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our forefathers to secure independence for Kenya, they were willing to pay any price, including prison and death.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should not say this but let me say it. For you to be successful in life, “do-or-die” (in a positive way) must be your motto.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Sacrifice was needed for Kenya's Independence*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have said something similar to this and I will say it again. Sacrifice is needed, for whatever you want to achieve in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our forefathers who fought for Kenya's independence sacrificed their peace, their joy, their friendship with the British government and a lot of other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no two way to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Law of nature demands that you forego something to get something.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give you a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was with a friend of mine sometimes back and when he was talking about wrestling, I couldn`t contribute (because I knew near nothing about wrestling).\n",
    "\n",
    "Angry, my friend (who is also aware that I don`t know much things about football) asked me, “So, what exactly do you know?”\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what I have to tell you.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would have become one of the most outspoken sports analysts today, if I had continued the way I was 17 years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I was a crazy football enthusiast. I could spend many hours watching football and many other hours arguing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However at some time, I discovered that I was killing my future, by wasting my time on things that didn`t give me money.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made a U turn. I sacrificed my pleasure of soccer and turned to good books (personal growth, business and financial books).\n",
    "\n",
    "Books takes the place of soccer, wrestling and movies in my heart and today, here is a man whose curious studies has helped to things he would never have achieved in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our forefathers to get independence for Kenya, they had to sacrifice a lot of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "For you to achieve success in any area of your life, sacrifice is a must.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as our forefathers sacrificed many things to get Kenya's independence, you must be willing to sacrifice some things (a lot of things) to get ahead in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Success is gradual*\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenyan independence`s fighters had been agitating for the freedom of their father`s land from the British for a long period of time before they got it on June 1st, 1963.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even then, the independence we got was not complete. The process was gradual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of us today want to get rich, fast. We want to achieve success, quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn`t work that way. It took Dangote, the richest African from Nigeria, two decades of hard (very hard) work to become the richest man in Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "A friend who knows my strange, determined way of life gave me a call sometimes back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we had departed for some years, he was asking me, “What is happening? I`m expecting you at the top!”\n",
    "\n",
    "He was expecting that the kind of person he knew me to be should have become one of the movers and shakers of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I’m moving the world already, but not as he expects. It`s happening gradually. It won`t just happen one day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward in the journey of life is always gradual, a step at a time, baby-step each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear friend, if you have tried a few things, ran some business, made some attempts and noticed that your progress is not encouraging, there is nothing wrong with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take heart. Endure. Persist. Continue fighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya's forefathers didn`t just get independence the first time they fought for it. They fought, persisted and gradually moved ahead towards the process of securing Kenya's freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Success is never final, Independence isn`t the end of war.*\n",
    "\n",
    "So many people have the idea that, if they can make much money, all their problems will be gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "That`s not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success is never final. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just at a time when you achieve something with your life, you will discover that it`s just like solving a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to one problem exposes us to another problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Kenya got her independence from the Britons, as expected, there was a big celebration and jubilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are free! We are independent! Was the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "But guess what? \n",
    "\n",
    "That was just the beginning of another problem (which we are still battling with, till now)\n",
    "\n",
    "The leadership and corruption problems we are facing today isn`t new. It started from the time we got our independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ethnic rivalry we are battling with today has been from the early days.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, even after Kenya became an independent nation, our problems didn`t end there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t over exaggerate success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Becoming successful will not make you fully happy, so don`t wait till all is well to be happy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cheer up, even now. \n",
    "\n",
    "And don`t expect that the success you want to achieve will solve all your problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now is the time to decide to be a happy man/woman.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Education is the weapon for Independence*\n",
    "\n",
    "By 1950s, many Kenyans had been getting education. Some had travelled to the United States and some to the United Kingdom.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happened next was that the educated Kenyans, since they had started knowing their right for freedom were then becoming more and more “arrogant” with the leadership of the colonial masters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Education was the most important weapon for the freedom of Kenya from the slave masters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing much is different with your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter what you wish to achieve with your life, education is the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want a blissful marriage? You must read good books about marriage.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want fame or political power? You must get books about history and past political heroes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to be a successful business man, or just become rich in your profession? You must invest your time in reading good business and financial books.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a great advocate of education, though I hate the kind of education school gives. I know, beyond any shadow of doubt that, knowledge is the key that opens doors of success and achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not for the knowledge that opened the minds of our forefathers, Kenya would never have been able to get her independence in the year 1963.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Slave masters sometimes train their slaves to fight for freedom.*\n",
    "\n",
    "It happened in the days of Moses (in the Bible) and till today it`s still happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slave masters sometimes will be responsible for the training of those that will set their people free.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Moses time, the princess of Egypt adopted Moses and trained him (with the best education) in the palace of king Pharaoh.\n",
    "\n",
    "But one day, when the time came for the Israelites to fight for their independence from Egypt, the very man the king trained was the most “violet” leader of the Jews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our independence fighters went to the United Kingdom to study, while others went to the United States to study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside that, Britain was having so many missionaries in Kenya, with the sole aim of introducing formal education to the nation it founded.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was how the slave master trained the slaves to seek freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal education was joyfully welcomed by many Kenyans. Their minds were opened. They then got courage to fight for Kenya's Independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear friend, slave masters sometimes train their slaves to fight for freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter what you are passing through today, that thing may end up being your training ground… if you don`t give up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also take advantage of the experience and knowledge you have gathered at your employment to start your own business venture instead of spending the rest of your life working for your master.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally* \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the six success lesson we all can learn from how Kenya's forefathers fought for Kenya's independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember;\n",
    "\n",
    "Freedom is not free… you have to fight for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sacrifice is needed… if you want to succeed in life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success is gradual… it takes time. Don`t give up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success is not final… after success comes another challenge you must face.\n",
    "\n",
    "Education is the weapon of achievement\n",
    "\n",
    "Slave masters sometimes train slaves how to seek freedom.\n",

    "02/06/2022, 10:38 am - +254 701 711058: *HOW TO START AN AUTO SPARE PARTS BUSINESS IN KENYA*\n",
    "\n",
    "With many cars on Kenyan roads, the auto spare parts business is a booming business in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "People need to change auto parts from time to time and when a car breaks down, thereby providing a large market for auto spare parts business. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start the business, you should have one thing in mind; that there is competition, very stiff, but if you do what we mention below in this article then it will be a smooth sail for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you should understand that most Kenyans import cheap cars from Japan, either by SBT or purchase locally from Car Bazaar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having this in mind, the spare parts to source include Toyota car spare parts, Mazda spare parts, Isuzu spare parts and Nissan spare parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the vehicles that dominate the Kenyan roads.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our research, you need at least half a million to start the business. I guess it’s quite some amount but you can manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data we have here shows that over 80% of Spare parts businesses in Kenya post profits of over Sh.100,000 per month. But there are selected few that make up to Ksh.3 million per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Research the Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the most crucial things to do before starting a business. Research helps you answer some of the questions you might have like; who are my target customers? Which place is most suitable for the business? How long will it take the business to pick up?\n",
    "\n",
    "All these will help you get a better plan for the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "To win in business, you must first understand the market and how the business works. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, you need to do a comprehensive market research. When researching the market, seek to understand auto spare parts in demand, good business location, auto spare parts pricing, where to source auto spare parts, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Write a Business Plan*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have carried out comprehensive market research, the next thing is to write a business plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "A business plan acts as a roadmap for any business. \n",
    "\n",
    "You get to layout your business goals and ways on how you plan to achieve them and also the period you are sure to have accomplished them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A business plan is very helpful since it keeps you on track with your goals, helps you identify your areas of weakness, and will also help you with investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have researched the market, it becomes very easy to write a business plan. You will need to put down your findings on a paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the items to list in your business plan include:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Business location\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For instance, you can start your auto spare parts business near a car wash, petrol station or a garage. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are complementary businesses that can help you get customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Register Your Business and Secure Business Permits*\n",
    "\n",
    "For every business in Kenya, there are legal formalities to go through before setting up the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to register the business and then get a business permit which you will be renewing annually. You will also be required to have a KRA Pin for tax payment and a National Health Insurance Fund for health insurance and you are good to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will cost you around Ksh.1,000 to register your business on E-Citizen while business permits will cost your around Ksh.10,000 annually. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to present your KRA certificate and a copy of your ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cost of Starting an Auto Spare Parts Business in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of starting an auto spare parts business in Kenya depends on the type of spare parts you are selling, business location, and the size of your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start a small spare parts business in Kenya, you need at least half a million. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are very few markets where demand exceeds supply. One such market is for Kiwi fruits which, despite being a relatively new idea in Kenya, has taken the market by storm. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are very few farmers who have gotten wind of its valued benefits and you can take advantage of this loophole to make a timely investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a step-by-step guide on how to go about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Kiwi Fruit Farming In Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Acquire or Lease a Piece Of Land*\n",
    "\n",
    "Kiwi vines grow well in areas with adequate rainfall and well drained soil. Think about areas that are neither too wet nor too dry and preferably with red soil which tends to be well drained (unlike black cotton soil).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example Uasin Gishu, Nakuru, Western Kenya, some parts of Kajiado, warmer parts of Central and Nairobi areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start out on a 1/8 th piece of land which can be leased at Ksh.5,000 to Ksh.20,000 per year or bought for Ksh.500,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Preparing the land will cost you an extra Ksh.10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Obtain Seedlings*\n",
    "\n",
    "Seedlings are quite rare to find but with a bit of searching you can always find them. Local nurseries as well as online classified sites like jiji.co.ke are good platforms to start your search.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the option of liaising with seed companies or The Kenya Agricultural Research Institution (KARI) for further assistance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Kiwi Vines that are ready for transplanting are retailing at an average of Ksh.300 per piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1/8 th piece of land will require about 50 vines amounting to Ksh.15,000 in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Plant & Care for the Vines*\n",
    "\n",
    "Plant the vines at around the month of March to take advantage of long-rains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Kiwi Vines are very vulnerable to strong winds and you may need to invest a bit more infrastructure-wise to protect them (e.g. by building a temporary fence or planting some trees around the farm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also you will need to invest in a compost manure and some little amounts of fertilizer (D.A.P and C.A.N) to provide the crop with adequate nutrients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kiwi plants are susceptible to a bacterial infection known as Psa and so you may need to invest in biochemicals that are usually used on fruits like oranges and grapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4: Your First Harvest*\n",
    "\n",
    "The average kiwi vine takes 2 to 3 years to mature and starts producing fruits. The first few harvests may however not be as productive but this tends to improve throughout the plants mature life.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can still commercialize your farm at this time by selling the few fruits that come out of it and healthy vines that you may choose to propagate (Remember, each vine goes for Ksh.300 on average, usually bought by new farmers).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 5: Take It To The Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "The local market is currently under-served as there are very few farmers who have taken up this idea. You can sell to roadside traders or even approach the big supermarkets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is even greater market potential in exporting to neighboring countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much to invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "For 1/8 acre piece of land you will require a minimum of Ksh.50,000 and a maximum of Ksh.100,000 to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cost may however rise if you are leasing or buying the piece of land for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much to expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "A 1/8 acre piece of land with 50 vines can produce 5,000 fruits per year (about 400 Kgs) on a bad season. \n",
    "\n",
    "A bumper harvest can reach up to 10,000 fruits (about 800 Kgs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Kiwi fruit currently retails at an average of Ksh.100. In other words, there’s potential for sales revenues of up to Ksh.1,000,000 per year on such a small piece of land.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, a single vine farm can produce healthy fruits for up to 15 years of maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many benefits of Kiwifruit farming in Kenya, including the fact that this is a relatively passive activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are potential challenges in that the idea is still new in the market and treading through uncharted territory isn’t always that easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see this as a medium to long-term investment opportunity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every business exists to sell something and without sales, all businesses would certainly die. \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why it’s always important to find out the real reasons why customers are not buying your products or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever you are selling, the whole idea of succeeding in business is to find customers who will gladly give you their money in exchange for that thing you are selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every year, hundreds of businesses close down around the world because they couldn’t make enough sales to keep the business going. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are several reasons why businesses fail, I will reveal the most common reasons why customers are not buying enough of your products or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is my intention that you will find something in this article that will change the way you sell your products and attract more customers to your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "These reasons you are about to find out were first revealed by Zig Ziglar, the great American sales and motivation guru. \n",
    "\n",
    "With some common sense, I have adapted them to the context of doing business in Africa. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your business suffers from poor sales, I have no doubt you will find this article very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. No need, no sales*\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody buys stuff unless they are hungry for it, or want it just for fun. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom line: People usually buy stuff they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest mistake most business people make is to sell a product that customers don’t need.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I have a full tank of petrol in my car and you are trying to sell me another 30 liters, you will be wasting your time. Why do I need extra petrol when I already have a full tank? \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if I could afford the petrol you are selling, I wouldn’t buy it because I don’t need it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at a practical example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fred lives in a Kasarani neighborhood with a large population of young working class people. Many of these people are single and work from 9 to 5 everyday. \n",
    "\n",
    "They come back home tired and spend their weekends catching up on lost sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fred comes up with a brilliant idea and starts a laundry business within the area. He offers to pick up dirty laundry from peoples’ homes and deliver them clean and fresh in under three days.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think happened? \n",
    "\n",
    "Business boomed! Why? \n",
    "\n",
    "His target customers had a desperate need for the convenience that his laundry service provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is often that many entrepreneurs do not target the right customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We often go ahead to create an amazing product or start up a business without first establishing that the market has a need for what we are selling (or about to sell). \n",
    "\n",
    "You may sell a wonderful product or deliver an amazing and professional service but if people don’t need it, they won’t buy it, no matter how hard you try.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would customers not need the product or service you are selling? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Competition* – If there is a product or business that already provides a solution to your target customers’ needs and problems, they wouldn’t buy from you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unless they are not satisfied with the product or service they currently use, it would be difficult to buy from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if your product is more valuable (cheaper, faster, better, safer etc.) than the ones they already use, they would, at least, consider yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Substitutes* – If I have a domestic help at home who does a good job with my dirty laundry, why would I want to pay a laundry business to do the same job? \n",
    "\n",
    "If my car runs on diesel and you are trying to sell me petrol (gasoline), why should I even listen to you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom line: If your target customers already have a substitute product or service that already does the same thing as your product, they may likely not need yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The lesson here is simple:* Any product that doesn’t solve an urgent pain or a pressing problem will be a tough sell to customers anywhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "More than 90 percent of sales happen because a customer needs a product or service to solve their pains and problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. No money, no sales*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have always wanted to own a helicopter. I don’t just need it; I want it. I desire it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am absolutely qualified to own this product but I don’t have the money for it; I just cannot afford it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I hate to admit it, I am not the type of customer a helicopter seller wants to see. No matter how much I love and adore the product, what use am I to the helicopter business if I don’t have the money in my pocket to buy one piece?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, a lot of businesses are facing this same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everybody tells you that your products are beautiful and amazing but nobody is bringing out their wallet to pay for them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even when there’s a serious need for the product or service, some businesses still find it hard to sell their products to enough customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would this happen? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of reasons.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Too expensive* – If your house was infested with rats and I offered to sell you a product that would kill all the rats in an instant, would you buy it? \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you would!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if I told you the price of this product is Ksh.10,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "What?! \n",
    "\n",
    "To kill rats? \n",
    "\n",
    "I’m sure you will take one day out of your busy schedule to ‘manually’ kill all the rats yourself or find much cheaper alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when the need is there and the product is right, a high price can spoil a sale. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most people, price is a sensitive issue. If the price is too high, they won’t buy. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Wrong market* – If you set up a Rolex watch business in a low-income neighbourhood, what do you expect? \n",
    "\n",
    "Most poor and middle-income people may strongly admire a luxury product but they cannot afford it. \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why location is a very important factor in setting up any business.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are surrounded by people who cannot afford to buy the products or services you are selling, then you are definitely in trouble. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an entrepreneur, you must target not just people who have a need for your product but who also have the money to pay for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Bad timing* – If you don’t understand the buying habits and patterns of your customers, you may just be selling to them at the wrong time. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to sell equipment to a large and established company, you should know that the best time to do this is just before their budget for the year is decided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good timing particularly works well as a sales strategy for customers who plan their spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, I learned an interesting lesson about timing from my cousin who sells clothes and shoes to her fellow students at university. \n",
    "\n",
    "She tells me that the best time to sell is just when students return to school after the holidays. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this time they are still flush with cash and are more likely to buy from her. Of course, as the semester advances, sales drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. No hurry, no sales*\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered why you see those adverts that say: \n",
    "\n",
    "“Buy now at 40 percent discount.” \n",
    "\n",
    "“Offer valid for 30 days only!” \n",
    "\n",
    "Procrastination is one of our oldest habits and a fundamental part of human nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when people see something they like, they may likely not buy it now and will most likely prefer to wait for later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The longer they wait, the lesser the likelihood that they will still remember or even buy your product at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because people are likely to postpone a buying decision, they often need to be encouraged to take action and buy now.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating a sense of urgency to buy your product or service, customers have a reason to make a decision immediately and reach out for their wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use hurry as a sales strategy, you also create an impression of scarcity for your products. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody likes to miss out on a good offer. Almost everybody likes to take advantage of a discount to enjoy a product or service at a lower and cheaper price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, there are a few ways to use the ‘hurry’ strategy to achieve the greatest effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "*At start up* – Hurry is an effective way to create awareness about a new business and start making sales as soon as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "A friend of mine who opened a hair and beauty salon successfully used this sales strategy to attract customers to her business. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the shop opened, she offered hair services, manicure and pedicure at a cheap price compared to other competitors for 7 days only. Of course, a lot of people came to enjoy the discounted cheap service. \n",
    "\n",
    "That single offer attracted most of her first clients who still remain loyal until today.\n",
    "\n",
    "*New product launch* – If you are already in business but have just introduced a new product or service to the market, the hurry sales strategy would also work well for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Offering the product for free or at an attractive discount for a fixed number of days will give your customers an opportunity to try out the product. \n",
    "\n",
    "If they like it, they will still keep buying even after the deadline for the ‘promo’ has expired.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good point you should keep in mind is that you should always use the hurry strategy with a fixed (short) deadline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why would anyone hurry to buy if the discount is permanent?\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also make sure that you are not being too pushy. The aim of using the hurry tactic is to encourage people to make a quick decision to buy from you rather than procrastinate. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are pushy, most people become defensive and may just never buy from you again. \n",
    "\n",
    "You just need to be cautious when you use the hurry tactic on customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. No desire, no sales*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people need to be motivated before they buy a product or service.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best ways to create desire for your product is to sell the benefits and results. People want to know what they will get or enjoy by spending their money on your product.\n",
    "\n",
    "One great example: \n",
    "\n",
    "Mariam is 30 kilograms overweight. She has been making plans to join a gym or start a weight loss program that will make her lose weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is, she’s been planning for five years now and still hasn’t done anything about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "She has a desperate need for a solution but is too busy to do any research to find one that’s right for her. \n",
    "\n",
    "She can afford a gym membership but she’s too lazy to find one that’s close to her house or office.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think would happen if I walked up to Miriam and told her that I have a proven formula that will make her lose her excess weight in just three months?\n",
    "\n",
    "What if I went ahead to show her ‘before’ and ‘after’ pictures of my previous clients who reached their target weights using my formula? \n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the price is right for her, Miriam would buy my product immediately! \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, after five years of delay, she would buy my product because I did something differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "And what exactly did I do differently? \n",
    "\n",
    "I created a desire for my product. By selling the benefits and results of using my product, I created a desire in Miriam that allowed her to make a quick decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many entrepreneurs don’t do a good job of letting customers know the benefits of using their products and services. \n",
    "\n",
    "People need to know that your product/service is better, cheaper, faster, safer, more effective etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two of the best ways I know to use desire to sell more of your products and services:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Always sell the benefits first* – Customers are selfish; they are always thinking about themselves and how your product or service will work for them. \n",
    "\n",
    "They don’t really care about the name of your product or the features that it has, customers are more interested in benefits and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an entrepreneur, you need to get into the habit of selling the benefits of your products and services first before anything else. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than telling a potential customer that you run a laundry service, tell them: “I wash dirty laundry and return them in less than 36 hours at a very affordable price.” \n",
    "\n",
    "*Be specific* – The more specific you are about the benefits and results your products can deliver, the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "By providing an idea of the value a customer will get from your products, you show that you are for real and know what you are talking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your product or service saves time, give an estimate of how much time it saves. \n",
    "\n",
    "If it’s cheaper than other products in the market, it’s a good idea to mention the amount of money the customer could save by using your product. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s always better to get specific with the benefits and results of your products.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. No trust, no sale*\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s no longer news that our markets are flooded with inferior goods and products that hardly work. \n",
    "\n",
    "We live in a time where people are more conscious about the health and safety of the food and water they buy and consume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyday, we learn of products and services that were paid for but never delivered. We live in a time of scams and conmen, and most people are increasingly suspicious of anything they buy unless it’s from a brand or business they trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trust and credibility are very essential for success in today’s world of business. If you don’t have them, it could significantly affect sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "How easy do you think it would be to sell an Apple, Nokia or Samsung mobile phone to a willing buyer? \n",
    "\n",
    "Very easy! \n",
    "\n",
    "Because these are brands that are already very well-known and trusted in the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lower the trust and credibility that people have for your product or service, the harder it would be to sell it to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But building and earning trust can take some time to happen. How can you do this if you are still a small or young business? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of ways you can start to build some trust and credibility among your current and future customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get Legal* – You would agree with me that it’s quite difficult to trust any business that isn’t compliant with the laws of the area, county or country where it does business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is your business a registered company? Do you have the necessary permits, licenses and approvals required for the type of business you are running? \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the little things that help to boost the trust and credibility of your business in the eyes of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Join relevant associations* – There are several local and international associations that are relevant to your type of business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Memberships for some of these organizations are free and you get to use their logos, seals and membership certificate to boost your reputation and credibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "Joining a relevant association instantly gives the impression that you are a professional who knows what he/she is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Showcase your track record* – If you have been doing a good job and serving your customers well, it’s a good idea to showcase the testimonials, letters of commendation and endorsements from your happy customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This creates social proof that your products and services are working and you are doing a really great job.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Provide guarantees and assurances* – Do you know what a ‘100 percent money-back guarantee’ is? It means that if customers don’t get the benefits from the product or service they bought, the business will refund the money they paid for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the easiest ways to create trust and credibility for your product. \n",
    "\n",
    "As long as your product or service performs as promised, experience proves that only a few people ever return to ask for their money back after they buy the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Now you know the reasons why customers are not buying, what changes will you make to improve your sales?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know why your sales have not been growing, what are you going to do about it?\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying some of the knowledge and tips you have learned from this article, you should start to notice some changes in the volume and satisfaction of your customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "And from time to time, you can always check back to make sure that you’re not breaking any of these important rules of sales success.\n",
    "\n",
    "I love you and I wish to see you become a successful entrepreneur.\n",

    "Leave alone the wild gooseberries that are self-propagating commonly found in farms after harvesting maize, farmers in Kenya can now access a high yielding variety of the fruit which is well known as the Cape gooseberry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new variety of Cape gooseberry, Netherlands Gold, produces bigger fruits in size. It also turns golden in colour when ripe and it is sweet, unlike the wild fruits which are somehow bitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, Netherlands Gold has a firm, waxy, gold skin giving it longer shelf life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wonder fruit (scientifically known as Physalis peruviana) which was traditionally left as food for the birds and hunters in forests has now been improved and is now a money miter for keen agro-entrepreneurs who would like to venture into a unique type of fruit production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fruit’s wide applications in the food industry and its health benefits makes it a darling among the rising health-conscious consumers in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to researchers, Cape gooseberries are an excellent source of vitamins A, B, and C and rich in protein and phosphorus making it anti-inflammatory, and which could help in the management of cancer, leukaemia, diabetes and hepatitis among other lifestyle diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the leaves of the gooseberry are utilized as medicinal teas. \n",
    "\n",
    "More value-added products such as gooseberry crumb cake, gooseberry cake, juice, jam and wine are other sources of income for the farmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for farmers, the fruit is the next big thing after it was selected by the government among the 100 crops for commercialization in the Big 4 Agenda.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Kenyan local dialects, the fruit is called differently, the Luo know it as Nyamtonglo, the Nandi people call it Mboniik,  the Kisii call it Chinsobosobo, Kikuyus call it Nathi, the Kipsigis refer to it as Chelolo while the Kamba call it Ngondu.\n",
    "\n",
    "*High yielding*\n",
    "\n",
    "The new variety-Netherlands Gold which matures in 12 - 14 weeks has a yielding capability of 5000 - 8000 kilos per acre and the seeds are planted in the nursery before transplanting seedbeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a quarter of an acre, you can plant 10 grams of seeds worth Sh.1,900, a half an acre takes 10 kilos of seeds going at Sh.2,800 while an acre needs 40 grams of seeds which can be bought at Sh.4,800.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average yield observed in Kenya is 5 to 8 tonnes per acre but under optimal management, this crop can yield up to 10 tonnes per acre.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Commercial potential*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start farming the fruits, and park them for the market, or make juice or even jam.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single plant can yield an average of 200 fruits which is about five grams per plant. This equals 1000g or 1kg fruits per season translating to 2kg per plant per year given the crop has two flowering seasons a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since an acre can accommodate 2500 plants, this will give 25000 × 1 = 2500kg of fruits which if sold at Sh.300 per kilo will give Sh.750,000 per acre in one season of about 12 - 14 weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you can double your earnings if you go the possible two seasons a year.\n",
    "\n",

    "As we always tell you, there’s no marathon race that has ever been won by those who did not start the race. \n",

    "\n",
    "Today let`s look into the life of the richest man in our great continent, Aliko Dangote and see few things we can learn about success and business.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know, some people are of the opinion that Dangote is “lucky” that`s why he became rich. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some say he uses political influence while some people are even of the opinion that the richest black man is fraudulent.\n",
    "\n",
    "I`m not here to defend him, but let me tell you three things.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, luck is part of life`s journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deny luck is to deny life entirely. Luck exists. And you know something, YOU too are lucky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people simply don`t look at the areas of their own luck, instead, they are busy seeing other peoples` luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that you`re reading this article shows that you`re lucky. Millions of people all over the world are blind. To these people, you`re very lucky.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of people in the world are cripples, armless, deaf etc. So many people have never seen their parents, not even for a day. So many people are mad and rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "To all of these people, you are very lucky (because you have the grace they don`t have). That`s why I don`t listen to people who claim that someone is lucky.\n",
    "\n",
    "When some people ridicule Aliko Dangote because he was “lucky” to be able to secure #500,000 Naira loan, what they don`t understand is that they too are lucky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, God and nature doesn`t distribute “luck” equally. But if you look around you very well, you will see some “luck” many other people don`t have.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about The Political Influence of Dangote?\n",
    "\n",
    "Every rich man has influence. However, that doesn`t mean that influence is bad or must be used for evil things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for instance if the Nigerian government decide to be strict about importation of some goods and let`s say cement is part of those goods, what will people say?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people will say, “That selfish man, Aliko Dangote has influenced our president to stop cement importation so that he will be able to sell more of his own cement”.\n",
    "\n",
    "That`s a lay man's thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though it may be Dangote who influenced the federal government decision in this area, the decision is not a bad one to make life difficult for people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importation kills a nation, every economics student knows this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let`s now learn one thing or two from the richest black man.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Aliko Dangote has been business minded from his childhood.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Even as a little boy, his mind has always been in the business world. \n",
    "\n",
    "He said, “I can remember when I was in primary school, I would go and buy cartons of sweets and I would start selling them just to make money. I was so interested in business, even at that time”.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can we learn from this?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, interest leads to passion. Passion leads to action. Though actions leads to mistakes and failures, it eventually leads to greatness (if we don`t give up).\n",
    "\n",
    "That short man (please don`t tell him) did not just become the richest African. He has been business minded, even as a little child.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing we can all learn is, the earlier the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you truly want to be a successful business owner, now, today is the right time to start. Start something, no matter how stupid that thing is.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Where you start doesn`t matter.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Many at times what is keeping us from starting out in business is, “what is a good business I can start?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people never find such good business because it really doesn`t exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn`t exist because nature demands that we get out before we know the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started business with nonsense. I mean a stupid thing I hate to think of (now, years after). Aliko Dangote started by selling sweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn`t really matter how you start. The only thing that matters is your willingness to pay the price, fight hard and stay focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, you know of Dangote Cement, Dangote sugar, Dangote salt, Dangote everything. Remember that guy started by selling sweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Aliko Dangote knew the kind of education he needed to achieve his vision*\n",
    "\n",
    "If Dangote had spent his first 32 years in school, he may not be the richest African today. \n",
    "\n",
    "That`s not to downgrade those who spend that much time in school, but to point out a lesson… don`t be deceived by what the society and people around you think is right for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The education you need depends on what you want to achieve with your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Education is very important, but school is not. You cannot achieve anything worthwhile without education, but you can achieve anything in the world without school.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you want to achieve with your life? What education do you need to achieve it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dangote knew he needed to be a business student. He started reading about business, listening to people talking about business and learn business, practically from his uncle.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Aliko Dangote passed through “on-job-training”*\n",
    "\n",
    "He was working with his uncle. The pay was not really his major goal (as other stories about his life show us), but the business experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with his uncle was like an “on-the-job-training” for the little Aliko.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can you learn for this? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to be a business owner tomorrow, but today you are an employee, start watching the way business is being done, by the way your boss does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unemployed, you can be an apprentice with someone running a good business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Look. Watch. Ask questions. You will build your business skills and have a good foundation for your business venture.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. He is a great negotiator*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have heard many people claiming that Aliko Dangote was simply lucky, to have had a rich uncle who could loan him some amount to start business.\n",
    "\n",
    "I disagree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Was Aliko the only son of that family? Are other sons now as rich as he is? Couldn`t they have used the same “luck’?\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you ever approach a rich brother or uncle for help? How easy is it to secure such help? \n",
    "\n",
    "Haven`t you heard many people saying, “My brother/uncle is very rich. He has money, but he can never give you money to start business”?\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is, no matter how rich your brothers, uncles or relatives are, getting resources to start your own business is not that cheap. There are certain things you have to meet up with.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of those things is, you must be a good negotiator. You have to know how to convince, persuade and sell your business vision before anybody will be willing to give you their hard-earned money or resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Dangote is credit-worthy*\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have to be credit worthy. Your life must be worthy of people`s trust. \n",
    "\n",
    "If Aliko Dangote`s uncle knew him as one unserious boy who spends money anyhow, would he have ever loaned him a penny?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the uncle knew him as a liar, would he have loaned him a kobo/shilling?\n",
    "\n",
    "How trustworthy are you? How credit worthy are you?\n",
    "\n",
    "I once heard a friend telling me, “Justine, I am loaning you this money because I trust you”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business life of Dangote shows us that he cares about what people think and say about him and his business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next point will emphasize that.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Aliko Deingote sells brand, not just products*\n",
    "\n",
    "He said, “To succeed in business, you must build a brand and never destroy it. One competitive advantage I had when I ventured into manufacturing was my brand, which I diligently built in the course of my trading”\n",
    "\n",
    "Don`t sell products or services. Sell brand. Sell trust. That`s how to make money from your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In whatever you`re selling or producing today, consider a brand that can last and make you rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do I mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start a business (even a little one), your primary goal should be to have loyal customers, loyal creditors and loyal employees and partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this only through the quality of your products or services, your honesty and consistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "What then happens is that, if tomorrow comes and you are going into a bigger business or industry, people who have trusted your name automatically trust your new product.\n",
    "\n",
    "That`s why Dangote could start selling sugar, salt, spaghetti, etc. and people buy them. \n",
    "\n",
    "That`s the reason why companies like Coca Cola could start selling any new product or any new type of soda today and people will say, “Coca cola makes it, so it will be good”\n",
    "\n",
    "*8. Dangote works like slave*\n",
    "\n",
    "To many people, the idea of being extremely rich is the idea of waking up each day to spend many hours before television, in parties or golf courts.\n",
    "\n",
    "That`s not true. Richest people in the world are working like mad. The only difference is that, most rich people are not working because they must work, this is unlike most poor people. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most rich people, their work is their hobby.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have heard a story about someone who boarded a plane with Aliko Dangote sometimes ago (maybe before he bought his own private jet). \n",
    "\n",
    "According to this story, most people on plane had slept off (it was night), yet, Mr. Dangote was busy checking this file, reading that thing, signing some other things, almost all night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another story has it that Dangote usually sleeps by 2.am and wakes up by 5.am.\n",
    "\n",
    "This attribute is common to every rich person you can name in our world today, hard work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*9. Aliko Dangote makes his hobby his job*\n",
    "\n",
    "I will explain this in two ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, one of the reasons why most people become rich in the first place is because they choose to concentrate their energy on a profession or business they are passionate about. \n",
    "\n",
    "This helps them to work extremely hard and still feel that they have not done so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, their work is nothing but a hobby. \n",
    "\n",
    "In another way, most rich people, when you ask them what their hobby is, they might tell you something related to their business or something helping their business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for instance if you ask Messi or Ronaldo what their hobby is, they may tell you, watching football. In that way, their hobby is still their business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other day I read an interview where Dangote said, “I love watching television”. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, that statement sounded strange.\n",
    "\n",
    "See, I have read about so many rich and successful people and I am yet to see anyone who loves T.V becoming great, except Oprah Winfrey, Larry Kings, Funmi Iyanda and the rest whose business is T.V itself (if you spend too much time on T.V, you actually have to repent).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when I continued with that interview, I heard something again from Dangote, “I love watching BUSINESS T.V such as Bloomberg T.V”\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Aliko Dangote loves spending hours watching T.V, they are never stations that waste your time with some useless movies, pornographic music or valueless “entertainment”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn something from that!\n",
    "\n",
    "*10. Aliko Dangote is a politician, but he won`t tell you*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, he is. He is a politician, but he will never tell you that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually in some way, most business people in the world including Kenya get involved with politics, but usually silently (except Donald Trump and a few others, you know).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do they do this? \n",
    "\n",
    "Because political leaders make policies that could affect their businesses, so they try and get involve, so that  they could have some influence on the policies of their country or territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not sure their hands are really pure in this angle, yet, I am not here to judge them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing you can learn about Aliko Dangote is that, you mustn`t declare yourself for any party. If you do and the opposition wins in an election, you may be one of their targets, I mean your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dangote gave a whole lot of money to PDP and Obasanjo`s projects but since he never declared in public that he belongs to PDP, when PDP lost power in the 2015 general election, he could easily draw near the ruling party.\n",
    "\n",
    "*11. Aliko Dangote loves Nigeria.*\n",
    "\n",
    "“Nothing can help Nigeria than for Nigerians to bring their money back here”. That`s Dangote talking. \n",
    "\n",
    "He has options of investing much of his money outside Nigeria, but he loves Nigeria so he stays in Nigeria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though he has many other investments in other countries of the world, Nigeria is still his favourite. “Give me $5 billion and I will invest everything here in Nigeria”, he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, some people are saying he dominates Nigeria's economy, he produces everything, he does this and he does that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone who has business understanding will not say most of those things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, he/she will appreciate Dangote for helping Nigeria`s economy by giving jobs to tens of thousands of Nigerians and by helping them to have more export or less import.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importation is bad for a nation. If we don`t produce things here, we will import them, therefore killing ourselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exportation is good for us, so if we have companies exporting stuff out of here, we will have a better economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "*12. He loves himself more than Nigeria.*\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how much you love your country or another person, you still have to love yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "When some people were criticizing Dangote for his interest in buying Arsenal football club, thinking that he should have invested his money in one of the numerous crawling Nigerian football clubs, what these people didn`t know is that, you sometimes have to go for what you love, at the expense of your love for your nation, friends, relatives etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*13. Dangote gives out.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you make much money, having money is your goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "What happens after you have all of the money you ever could spend all your life?\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point having money doesn`t make much sense again. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though you may still be working hard to acquire more and more, your goal might have changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So many billionaires are still working not because they need more money, but sometimes because they want more power, fame (i.e. the richest African) or simply to be able to give more and more money out.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don`t know all others, you will know that Aliko Dangote donated about #150 million to tackle Ebola when the disease broke out in Nigeria.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Here is my last word.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The above opinion about Aliko Dangote is mine and it`s by no means “all truth”. \n",
    "\n",
    "He is human. He makes mistakes and does wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "I only wish you could learn one or two things from him.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pixie oranges continue to become very popular among Kenyan consumers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because this variety of oranges is a lot sweeter than the large ordinary oranges, juicier and their orange flavour is very sharp. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, if you cut a pixie orange in a room, its refreshing smell will be calling someone from the next room. \n",
    "\n",
    "Farmers have realized the huge opportunity arising from the demand and are making efforts to fill the gap. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the few pixie orange farming activities in Kenya are far from meeting the growing demand within the country and even abroad.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pixie farming areas in Kenya*\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a variety of citrus fruits, pixie oranges thrive in hot climatic conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Makueni County leads in the production of this fruit, followed by the other Ukambani counties of Machakos and Kitui. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hot Baringo County is also hot on the trail and gladly, the coastal people of Kwale and Taita Taveta have woken up to the opportunity even though in very small scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Grafted trees mature faster*\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixie oranges originated from California and are seedless. Therefore, the only available method of propagating this variety in Kenya is by grafting. \n",
    "\n",
    "This brings forth another advantage in that the grafted seedlings mature faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grafted pixie oranges will mature after 2 to 3 years depending on how well they are taken care of. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first, each tree will give a few fruits; about 30 to 50 fruits. This production increases every year as the branches grow wider. \n",
    "\n",
    "The highest yield is attained in the 4th or 5th year in which each pixie tree can give up to 300 fruits; about 60 kgs per tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How to grow pixie*\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixie can grow in many different types of soils. However the best soils are the well drained sandy loam soils. Like many other fruit trees, pixie requires fertile soils with a high humus content and a pH level of between 6.5 and 7.4. \n",
    "\n",
    "The planting holes should be prepared well to a size of 2x2 feet – 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep. \n",
    "\n",
    "Separate the top soil from the bottom soil and use the rich top soil mixed with manure to plant your seedlings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mix the soil and manure at the ratio 1:2 (1 bucket of manure for 2 buckets of soil. \n",
    "\n",
    "When filling back the whole with the mixture of soil and manure, ensure you leave about 10 cm to create space for watering your seedlings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Best climate for growing pixie*\n",
    "\n",
    "The best climate for pixie farming in Kenya is warm or hot with temperatures between 10℃ and 30℃. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rainfall should be at least 1,000 mm annually although this can be supplemented through irrigation to achieve optimum yields. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fruit thrives between the sea level and an altitude of about 2100m.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Recommended spacing for pixie*\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixie orange trees grow to a height of 4 meters and spread to a radius of 3m. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the recommended spacing for pixie is 3 by 5 meters: 3m from plant to plant and 5m from line to line. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this spacing, one acre will accommodate around 270 high yielding trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "The distance in between the rows of trees is kept at 5 meters to allow sufficient work space for spraying and harvesting. This space can also be used to grow cover crops such as beans.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why you should do pixie orange farming in 2022*\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixie orange farming is very profitable with an acre giving a turnover of up to Ksh.1.2 million per year as reported by farmers in Makueni. \n",
    "\n",
    "These fruits are sold at an average price of Ksh.80 per kilo at the farm gate. \n",
    "\n",
    "A well tended tree will give 60 kilos of fruits in a year and an acre can accommodate 270 such trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "Supermarkets and grocery shops currently form the largest market for pixie oranges in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is already a huge market that has not had enough of these tasty fruits. \n",
    "\n",
    "A kilo of pixie retails for as high as Ksh.200 making them look like fruits for the rich. \n",
    "\n",
    "The larger Wakulima Markets are yet to get a good share of pixie oranges. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we cannot even talk about the exporting companies that are constantly hunting for the fruits and offering prices as high as Ksh.150 at the farm gate.\n",
    "\n",

    "05/06/2022, 7:47 pm - +254 754 839228: *HOW TO RAISE SEED CAPITAL FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS*\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you about asking your family and friends for funds? \n",
    "\n",
    "If YES, I will guide you on how to successfully raise seed capital for your business from family and friends without wrecking your relationship with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is one thing to know how to finance a business, but it is a different ball game entirely to successfully raise the funds you need. Raising capital is one of the major business challenges faced by entrepreneurs; especially when starting a business from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s much easier to raise capital as an established entrepreneur than to raise capital as a first time startup entrepreneur. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now there may be times when you try to gather some money for your business—for example, by selling some of your assets or taking a job—but the cash just won’t add up. There may be times when your family and friends are not willing to give you the money you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Times like these could be very frustrating, but successful entrepreneurs never bow to frustration. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, you have to find a way to work things out. If the money you have is much less than what you need, and you have no chances of getting more, then you may have to let go of some share of your business. That is, you may want to consider equity financing. This may be a very hard decision, but it’s better you take it than remain stagnant.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many possible sources of equity financing. However, one of the very first places entrepreneurs turn to when seeking capital is their family and friends. \n",
    "\n",
    "So today, I will teach you how to raise funds; I mean equity, not gift—from family and friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the idea sounds good, since it’s very easy to get money from people who love you and have known you for years. They would be willing to write you a check because you are someone they trust and would readily help. But instead of giving you some of the money you need, some friends and relatives would rather agree to invest some capital in return for some share of your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this may be a fair option, it means that they will have some say in the control of the business and will be entitled to a fraction of the profits you generate. The importance of family and friends in the life of an entrepreneur can never be over emphasized; so in this article, I will teach you how to leverage your family and friends to launch your business successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how do you leverage your family and friends to successfully start a business?\n",
    "    \n",
    "How do you raise seed capital from your family and friends?\n",
    "\n",
    "Raising startup seed capital from family and friends happens to be one of the easiest avenues for raising capital that entrepreneurs can exploit. But if wrongly done, you can get your fingers burnt and even end up destroying the existing good relationship you have with your family and friends. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like other strategies for raising seed capital, raising money from close ones has its challenges, advantages, and disadvantages which you will learn about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you want your friend or relative to invest in your business out of conviction that your idea is a brilliant one, and not out of their shyness to turn you down? \n",
    "\n",
    "Then here are tips you must adopt during your meeting to make them gladly write you a check or give you that cash:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Be in the right mindset*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not in the right mindset, forget about trying to raise seed capital from your family and friends. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now why do I emphasize you be in the right mindset before trying to raise capital from your family and friends? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the fact that you are trying to source capital from family and friends doesn’t eliminate the odds of disappointment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What if your trusted friend turns you down?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*What if your most loved one says no to your business plan?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*How will you feel if you get laughed at, mocked or looked down upon by your loved ones?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to these questions is the reason I emphasize you be in the right mindset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before trying to raise capital from family and friends; you must be prepared to face rejection, criticism and mockery. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, expect disappointment from even the person you love most. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I emphasize you be in the right mindset is because disappointment from your family and friends can strain the good relationship shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had a personal experience with respect to this case. I remember vividly when I caught the entrepreneurial bug some years ago and began nursing the desire of running my own business. \n",
    "\n",
    "I had some excellent business ideas which I was excited about and my determination to scale through kept my head buried in books while my mates were partying. I even attended seminars to sharpen my entrepreneurial skills and learn how to build a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a feeling of confidence and excitement about starting a business, I shared my business plan with my parents. \n",
    "\n",
    "But instead of getting a word of encouragement; all I got was a hard stare from my dad and a detailed explanation of how incompetent I was with respect to starting a business. My dad told me to my face that I was still a kid and advised me to face my studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be sincere with you, I was very disappointed. In fact, I was annoyed with my dad back then. After all my effort and time spent developing a business idea, drawing up a business plan and honing my business skills; my dad had the effrontery to call me a (incompetent) kid, despite the fact that I had spent reasonable time running his own business. \n",
    "\n",
    "I felt like giving my dad a punch in the face for challenging my competence; and if not for the encouraging words from my mom, I don’t know what would have become of the sweet relationship between me and my dad.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I lay on my bed and recalled this particular experience; it occurred to me that young entrepreneurs all over the world may also be going through this same experience and that was why I wrote this piece. \n",
    "\n",
    "No matter where you are sourcing your startup capital from; always respect the odds that you can get turned down. Don’t take rejection personal; it’s the norm in the business world.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Build up your credibility*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now since the odds of raising seed capital for your startup business remains the same despite the source you are exploiting; then how do you increase your chances of getting the financial support you need? \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to that question is “good credibility.”\n",
    "\n",
    "*What are you known for in your family?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*What’s your level of relationship with family and friends?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Can you be trusted?\n",
    "   \n",
    "*How well did your past dealings with family and friends go?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Have you handled any project on behalf of the family?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*How do you live your life?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Are you an asset to the family or a liability?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Are there any habits that could be a hindrance to your aspirations?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the questions you must answer before trying to raise capital from family and friends. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody wants to give money to a scumbag or an incompetent friend or relative, and neither would I. \n",
    "\n",
    "I once told my brother that I would never invest a dime in any of his projects if he doesn’t gain a stronger control over his life and finances. I made this statement to help my brother have a greater sense of responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven’t got control over your life and the way you spend money; then it’s high time you change and reconsider your life’s pattern because a single bad habit can reduce your chances of raising money from family and friends. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that these two groups know you to the core; they know your strengths and weaknesses. In fact, they know personal things about you that even venture capitalists and angel investors may never find out.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Have a good business plan*\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t walk up to your members of your family or friends and try to raise money without a good business plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how much they love you, they will still want to know what you need the money for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you are not going to share the intricacies of your business plan with them; at least they deserve to get an overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to understand your plans like the back of your hands especially when you are coming from a family of intellects or trying to raise capital from learned friends. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your plan sounds too shallow or incomprehensible; you may be denied the financial support you need. But before sharing your business plan with your family and friend; you must make sure step one and two above are sufficiently taken care of.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Approach them like strangers*\n",
    "\n",
    "Forget for the moment that your investor is a friend or family member. You need to present your well-prepared business plan, not a rough draft. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make it an “arm‘s length” transaction, and insist on the same sort of legal documentation you would prepare if your investor were a total stranger. \n",
    "\n",
    "Give all the necessary explanation, and most importantly, allocate a reasonable share of your business that equates with their investment\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Have a Good Story to Tell*\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have a good story backing your business plan and intentions? \n",
    "\n",
    "If your answer is no; then you better reconsider your approach because your proposal and request may be thrown back at you. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that you are trying to raise capital from family and friends doesn’t mean you should take them for granted. Threat them professionally with a touch of informality and back your business plan with a good story.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How did you develop your business idea?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*What are your chances of success?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*How viable is your idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "Try sharing the answers to these questions with your family and friends because it has been proven that humans listen to stories more than anything else. \n",
    "\n",
    "So share a story worth telling about your business plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Be straightforward*\n",
    "\n",
    "Be very straightforward about why you need the money, what you will use it for, and how they will get it back. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you aren’t realistic with them upfront, then you are setting yourself up for a nightmare. Have a plan and strategy before going into the discussion. \n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to business, leave out informality. Prepare well ahead of your meeting with friends or family members.\n",
    "\n",
    "And be serious during your presentation so that you will be taken seriously. \n",
    "\n",
    "When stating your facts, be specific so that you will come across as serious-minded fellow. And when asking for the money you need, state the specific amount, not a rough estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing encourages an investor more than the awareness that you have really done your homework well. And nothing creates this awareness than a specific and straightforward presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Select your Targets*\n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb when raising seed capital from family and friends is this; “don’t go telling every dick and harry in your family about your plans.” \n",
    "\n",
    "Select a few prospects among your family and friends that have the potential to provide the capital you need and prepare a pitch tailored to their life pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when I was trying to pitch my dad to invest in my business idea; I prepared myself properly because my dad was a strict individual who knows the fundamental intricacies of business. He doesn’t believe in throwing money around; and when it comes to money issues, he is strict about it with his children.\n",
    "\n",
    "So knowing my dad was a no-nonsense person; I had to be straight and clear while pitching my ideas to him. Though, I still got turned down; I left his presence with some lessons about the challenges involved in raising capital. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson I am trying to extract here is this;\n",
    "\n",
    "“The way you pitch a family member of high academic intellect will be very different from the one used to pitch a friend who is already an entrepreneur; or a family member who is stingy when it comes to money.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Different pitch for different people and situations; never use the same words for people with different core values. What may attract a professional investor may turn off an academic scholar.\n",
    "\n",
    "*8. Sell Yourself*\n",
    "\n",
    "The next key to successfully raising seed capital from family and friends is your ability to sell yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why should your family and friends give you their hard earned money?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*How are they sure the money will be used judiciously?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*How are they sure you are not trying to con them?\n",
    "    \n",
    "*You have failed on a previous project, why should they trust you on this one?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where selling yourself comes in. This is where you sell your potentials and competence to members of your family and friends; this is where you prove that you know your onions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your ability to sell yourself is key to your success. You must explain in details why your friend or family member should invest their hard-earned money in your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show them proof that the business is potentially lucrative. Instill in them the same enthusiasm you have about your idea, and they will ready write you a check or give you the cash. \n",
    "\n",
    "Never approach them with the idea that they will give you some money without asking any questions simply because they are close to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a money-related issue, so they won’t be that dumb! \n",
    "\n",
    "If you successfully carry out step one to five and you miss it here; all your effort will be in vain. You will never get the needed capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "*9. Ask for the Money*\n",
    "\n",
    "If step one to six goes successfully; then you have to take the next action step which is asking for the money. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before asking for the money; you must be definite on your plans, you must know how much you need and the terms involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing annoys me more than an entrepreneur pitching me with his business plan and when I ask how much in capital he wants to raise; he or she becomes speechless or uncertain. \n",
    "\n",
    "So when raising capital from family and friends; it’s advisable you know your business plan like the palm of your hands, sell yourself excellently and ask for the money.\n",

    "\n",
    "The phenomenal growth of Somali businesses in Kenya’s commercial towns and urban centres is an envy to any would-be entrepreneur or business person.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the often frequented restaurants in Nairobi’s Central Business District to well-stocked boutiques their business models have created a massive economic touch, which cannot be overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eastleigh is just a Ksh.50 bus ride from Nairobi CBD.\n",
    "\n",
    "‘Little Mogadishu,’ as Eastleigh is nicknamed, owing to the largely Somali population, is an interesting study of culture and business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides Somalis, there are Eritreans and Ethiopians in this neighbourhood that never sleep. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though outsiders, these immigrants have injected into Eastleigh the do-or-die work ethic characteristic of ‘displaced communities’ and attendant reciprocal relationship built on networks and trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eastleigh, Nairobi’s xanadu of commerce, boasts more shopping malls than anywhere else in Kenya, besides a 24-hour economy via its multi-billion shilling wholesale and retail enterprises.\n",
    "\n",
    "But despite decades of living together, there are hardly any inter-marriages between the ‘foreigners’ and locals, owing to cultural orientation, religious persuasion and the insularity and herd mentality of migrants. \n",
    "\n",
    "But why are they more successful in business than locals?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is simple: trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "An illustration will do: \n",
    "\n",
    "Ten business people from, say, Central Kenya, will collectively buy air tickets for a business trip to Guangzou, China. At Sh.120,000 per ticket, that comes to Sh1.2 million, of course minus accommodation and logistics escalating overheads and later cost of the goods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why don’t these Central Kenyans just send one of them? \n",
    "\n",
    "Trust issues!\n",
    "\n",
    "Their Somali counterparts, on the other hand, will send orders to their contact in Guangzou and pay using the informal money transfer system called Hawala. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trust sees their goods cost less due to shared costs for the logistics and economies of scale via their global and social distribution networks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These social capital is not common among miros in Central Kenya, where lack of trust sees smallholder tea and dairy farmers selling their produce individually, yet combining, cooperative style, could yield higher returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lumping one and two-acre parcels into ranches could make their shambas more economically viable, but mistrust over beacons and boundaries has ensured blighting poverty takes root. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, ‘telephone farming’ is a challenge to most urbanites, largely due to untrustworthy villagers, mostly screwed up relatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a job to keep, a boss to impress and bills to pay, salaried people cannot afford to completely ditch their comfortable 8.am to 5.pm lifestyle. \n",
    "\n",
    "So they hire and entrust their relatives or village-mates to run the affairs of the so-called side business. And therein lies the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first person they hire proves too lazy and unambitious, so they fire him. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second person they hire is a family member who clearly lacks the zeal and expertise to run the business, so once again they fire him when they notice the business is on its deathbed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third and final person (or the mortician if you may) is usually a former village-mate or an old friend who despite being passionate excels in dishonesty. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you know it, the once emaciated chap milks the business dry and escapes (not back to the village but to start his own venture using money and experience stolen from the unsuspecting boss.)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of it all, one is left with no other option than to simply close the business, count losses and repay a loan without getting any value in return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trust is a component of culture and in his 1995 book, Trust: The Social Virtues and The Creation of Prosperity, American political scientist, Francis Fukuyama argues that people and countries with high trust equities such as Japan, America and Germany, are economically more successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind this upward curve though is a business based on trust, a character trait that has remained elusive in many conventional entrepreneurs, who find it hard to trust their wealth with others, however creative their ideas may be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trust, in a good number of the Somali community resonates loudly in respect to raising enough capital among family members and close friends for a profitable venture as well as one that creates an even economic impact in the entire society.\n",
    "\n",
    "Takaful Insurance Managing Director Hassan Bashir agrees that trust in the community has played an incredible role in fuelling success in their business growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ours is a business model that is based on trust as shown by the community. Such ventures thrive since it’s founded on the human spirit,” he argues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The human spirit, he reckons, is one where both the seller and buyer trust that the product is certified and is of good quality. This is not the practice where Nairobi residents and visitors at times buy donkey meat, instead of beef.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a pastoralist community, he says, the Somali has a practice where they give some members a cow in the hope that they will return it. “This is where our trust to transfer capital from one trustworthy individual has been inherited from.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a resilient people, Somalis have prospered because they are willing to take risks and accept smaller profits, which is another factor that has seen their business thrive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Abdullahi Dahir, the director at the Imara Daima Gardens, explains that when it comes to trade, “everyone wants to be very competitive in terms of the pricing factor, so it’s the margin that people are looking for. While other traders are looking for a higher margin, a Somali trader is looking for a lower margin. They’re looking at the turnover.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Staying together for years to create a business empire without any break up is a rare gem in majority of business partnerships and the Somali community offers vital lessons, albeit in a small way.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is a sunny day in Burma Market and workers at Karanja’s shop are busy loading bags of bones into one his vehicles and motorbikes parked by the roadside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clothed in a khaki trouser, blue shirt, a white coat and gumboots, the-40-year old makes several trips in and out of his warehouse which is packed with piles of camel heads and bones in a refrigerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2002, Robert Karanja aka Waria, left Kabati in Muranga County for greener pastures in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "He left home with nothing and started pulling carts around Muthurwa and Burma markets. After saving Sh.8,000, he decided to try his luck in business and opened Supu ya Ng’ombe Kiosk in Burma which was closed down.\n",
    "\n",
    "While in town, Karanja made friends; one of them was of Somali origin. They met in Eastleigh, hit it off and a business idea was conceived.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through trust and friendship, he was able to raise some money to rent a small stall in Burma market where he set up camel bones shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "“When I started this business I had no money to go to Mandera, Isiolo and Marsabit to buy the camels because it is costly. What I did was sell bones and heads purchased from Mlolongo slaughterhouse and soon, I had saved enough to buy my first camel,” said Karanja.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transporting the animal from Isiolo to Nairobi was Karanja’s next headache and when he could not afford Sh.80,000 to transport the animal in a truck, he stuck a deal with a local who trekked with the animal from Isiolo Nairobi.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Starting this business was tough. It costs Sh.80,000 to transport the camel and I had no money that time so I decided to look for someone from Isiolo who would bring the camel to Nairobi for Sh.20,000. I was restless because I was afraid the camel might die or get sick on the way. The camel arrived after three weeks and the rest is history,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Karanja is a leading supplier of camel bones, a popular ingredient in supu ya ngamia kiosks spread all over towns in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "“At around 4pm this place is normally packed with pregnant women with their small bags to carry bones; because doctors recommend camel soup for its high calcium nutrient. Also, those who suffer from Arthritis and fractures frequent here a lot. I sell a kg of bones between Sh.100 and Sh.200 but it depends on the size.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day, Karanja wakes up at 4am and, “I slaughter 10 camels daily and sell the meat in hotels across the city. One kilogramme of camel meat goes for Sh.600. I also sell camel feet and hooves to Chinese and Indians for Sh.200 per kg before I transport bones to various companies that make bone meal and ornaments. Camel oil goes for between Sh.2,500 and Sh.3,000 per mtungi.”\n",

    "Every two weeks, Karanja travels to Mandera and Marsabit to buy camels at Sh.60,000 to Sh.120,000 each.\n",

    "\n",
    "Gone are the days when one would graduate from college with professional courses such as engineering and get employed within a very short time. \n",
    "\n",
    "With thousands of graduates flocking out of our universities every year, just pursuing a professional course is not a guarantee that a job is waiting for you when you graduate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many graduates get depressed due to lack of job openings upon graduation even after becoming top in their classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electrical and electronics engineering students have a chance to put to practice the skills they acquired in college even as they wait to get employed. You never know how long the wait may be. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you graduated with a bachelors degree or a diploma in electrical and\n",
    "electronics engineering, don’t get depressed job hunting. As you write applications and drop your CV and other documents, start an appliance repair business to keep you busy while earning some money.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Potential*\n",
    "\n",
    "All homes have electrical gadgets and machines of all types, such as television sets, radios, fridges, iron boxes, cookers, air conditioners, microwaves, computers and many others. Businesses have machines that use electrical energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "These appliances need service and repair every now and then and with the number of homes and businesses ever increasing, an appliance repair business has a very huge potential to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many homes will have breakdowns on these equipment once in a while, same to the machines in businesses and other organizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up this appliance repair business will therefore be a good idea since you will have lots of opportunities. Household gadgetry\n",
    "and automation are expanding, ensuring a future revenue stream for people who are able to repair them.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tools*\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with your knowledge in electronics and electrical engineering, starting this busyness is very simple. All you will need are simple tools such as screw drivers, pliers (long nosed and normal type), cutters, soldering gun and soldering iron/wire, a set of spanners (get the common small range such as 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19 MM). \n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t start with big sizes. Appliance repair jobs do not need those. Big sizes are mostly used for mechanical engineering jobs. You will also need a tester and a small voltage meter. Remember the screw drivers should be of various sizes, small, big and medium, both star and flat\n",
    "(sometimes called ‘minus’).\n",
    "\n",
    "With a budget of about Ksh.15,000 – Ksh.25,000, you can buy these tools and remember to go for quality tools to avoid going back to the shop after a few jobs. \n",
    "\n",
    "These tools will be enough to start you off in your appliance repair jobs but you can buy more with time as you proceed with the business. Later when your budget allows, you can look for a complete professional toolbox with many other tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your tools well and treat them with care since your business will depend on them. Without the right tools, or if they are faulty, you will be greatly limited in your ability to successfully accomplish the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Marketing*\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in any other business, marketing is a very important aspect of this appliance repair business. Do not sit back and wait for those with broken down equipment to call you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are that they may not even know that you exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go out and tell people including your neighbours, friends, relatives and even strangers that you are in appliance repair business. Print out business cards and place them in local shops, businesses and homes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Form partnership with used appliance dealers and appliance shops and ask them to refer those who need a service technician to you. You can also post advertisements in shopping malls and other areas with high foot traffic for maximum exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word of mouth will also be a very good form of marketing in appliance repair business. Just do a good job, be courteous, honest, punctual, flexible, keen, organized and cheerful and your customers will spread the good news about you. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good idea to have simple spares such as fuses, fuse wires, extra wires, screws and nuts which you can use\n",
    "\n",
    "whenever necessary. This will reduce the time it takes to carry out some of these repair jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Income*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this appliance repair business, your income will come from the fee you charge for repair and service of appliances and other gadgets. You should come up with a suitable form of charging for your labour. Your charges will depend on the appliances repaired and if there are spare parts to fix, you should include the cost of these in your fee, if you buy them with your money. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the best way is to have the client buy the spares as per your\n",
    "recommendations and just charge for labour. Some may give you money to buy the spares.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common method of charging for these repairs is by assessing the work required and coming up with a fixed figure, say Ksh.5,000 or Ksh.2,000 or whatever amount depending on the work involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rule of thumb is; charge more for more expensive appliances and less for cheaper appliances. Allow room for negotiations as well, don’t be\n",
    "too rigid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing with these repairs is that some can take a very short time, even 10 – 20 minutes. It could just be a blown fuse, a broken or loose connection or a simple short circuit that earns you Ksh.500 or ksh.1,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a good network and get a number of such jobs a day, you could earn a decent income by the end of the day or week.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Advantages of this business*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The business is flexible and you may not need fixed premises. You can work 24 hours since most of the work will either be at your client’s home or at your home.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Business is assured since more and more gadgets and appliances are being bought in homes and businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Very little capital is required to set up the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disadvantages of this business*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Possibility of injuries while using work tools or transporting heavy appliances plus exposure to electrical shocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. More consumers are replacing rather than repairing broken appliances because it’s often cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Some tasks may need very specialized equipment that may not be readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have the qualifications or engineering skills, you can still start this business and employ qualified people to work for you while you deal with marketing and business management aspects of your business.\n",

    " \n",
    "There is never a fixed amount of revenue that you are expected to get.\n",
    " \n",
    "With mitumba business, you can make a profit of more than 50% of the buying price with a suitable location with many customers like near colleges or in market centers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The startup cost is low and you can start with little capital and grow your business over time. \n",
    " \n",
    "Its expenses are less since you only need to pay for licenses and permits. You can opt to sell from a store, open market centers or online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mwangi, who asked me not to use his real name, has been a mitumba distributor since 2011 when he took the business over from his mother. “I am a textiles importer,” he says. Textiles are items like clothes, beddings, towels, curtains, dish and table clothes.\n",
    " \n",
    "He describes the journey once the clothes are given over for export to third world countries. Export companies buy what doesn’t go to charity, for up to 0.90 cents USD (Sh.91) per kilo. The items are then sorted, graded, fumigated and packed for export. \n",
    " \n",
    "“Once they have been processed, the second-hand clothes are packed into 45-kilo bales. Each bale is graded,” he says. \n",
    " \n",
    "Grade A items are in near-new condition. Grade B items are gently used and in good condition. Grade C goods have minor defects. Grade D clothes have major defects.  These companies are in business with local guys like Mwangi.\n",
    " \n",
    "“The bales are packed into a standard 40-foot container. One container takes 550 bales,” says Mwangi. That’s 25 tonnes of clothes.\n",
    " \n",
    "Mwangi is based at Gikomba Market, the largest second-hand market in East and Central Africa, and the core distribution point for mitumba merchandise in the country. \n",
    " \n",
    "His store is a simple timber and mabati structure with a concrete floor. It’s hard to believe that he deals in goods worth millions. Bales run the length and breadth of his shop.\n",
    " \n",
    "“I buy the 40-foot container for 50,000 USD (Sh.5 million). I have a shipping company so my suppliers in Canada and Australia load it into our ship. \n",
    " \n",
    "I used to import from China but not anymore, their quality was not good. \n",
    " \n",
    "It takes between four weeks to seven weeks for the container to get to the port of Mombasa. I have my agent who clears the consignment for me,” he says. \n",
    " \n",
    "“A 40-foot container costs around Sh.1.5 million to clear.”\n",
    " \n",
    "Mwangi pauses to speak to some retailers who have come to buy bales. Mwangi tells them that another shipment is on the high seas, and that it won’t get here until next month. They leave, disappointed.\n",
    " \n",
    "Which brings us to another reason the business is profitable: no taxes are levied on the items you and I purchase. \n",
    " \n",
    "Githii Mburu, a deputy commissioner at KRA (Kenya Revenue Authority), says, “We don’t collect taxes from the people who sell mitumba, unless that business is registered for VAT. All taxes on mitumba are collected at the point of entry only. The mitumba sector is an informal economy that is yet to be brought into the tax net.”\n",
    " \n",
    "Mwangi continues, “We load the container onto a truck then it heads for our warehouse in Industrial Area, where it will be offloaded. I keep all the bales there. \n",
    " \n",
    "My rent for the warehouse is Sh.80,000 per month. I move the bales from the warehouse to my store in Gikomba. I pay Sh.20,000 per month for this space in Gikomba. My customers come to collect the bales from here.”\n",
    " \n",
    " “A bale costs anywhere between Sh.1,500 to Sh.50,000,” Mwangi says.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The cheaper bales are for items that aren’t in high demand like ties and men’s coats. The expensive bales are for trendy items of camera 1 and 2 – items like designer jeans and jackets.”  \n",
    " \n",
    "In Gikomba, says Mwangi, the lingo for the grades is ‘camera 1’ for Grade A, ‘camera 2’ for Grade B, ‘camera 3’ for Grade C and ‘wa kufagia’ for Grade D.\n",
    " \n",
    "Mwangi can sell up to 100 bales in a day. That’s upwards of Sh1.5 million. \n",
    "\n",
    "But he considers himself a small businessman; there are some who ship in up to three containers a week, others more. \n",
    "\n",
    "It takes him about two months to sell all the bales from one container, which is around the time another consignment lands in Mombasa.\n",
    " \n",
    "The mitumba business employs a sub-structure of support. There is a whole other industry of fundis who repair clothes and shoes. There are people who steam-iron the clothes. There are transporters, security… the buffet is endless. The cost of these services range from Sh.20 to Sh.200.\n",
    " \n",
    "Below Mwangi are brokers who deal in the trade of buying then opening the bales to sell individual pieces to retailers. Breaking the bales, it’s called, and it runs on priority basis, with ‘camera 1’ being given the first priority to select items from the opened bales, then ‘camera 2’ and so on.\n",

    "There is therefore a great business opportunity in children’s events and entertainment business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a children’s event and entertainment business is a great way to earn good money every weekend, public holidays and on special occasions such as birthdays and other children’s parties. It will also help children and parents enjoy special occasions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Equipment*\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up a children’s entertainment business, there are particular equipment that you will need to keep the kids entertained. Most of the equipment are available locally therefore this is a business you can start right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bouncing castle, is one key equipment that such a business will\n",
    "obviously require. These castles are available locally or can be imported. They come in a variety of shapes, colours and sizes. This is an inflatable toy designed like a house that is blown up using a pump and children pay inside. When not inflated, it can be folded and carried around easily. With less than Sh.100,000 you can get a good bouncing castle to start\n",
    "with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another equipment that will come in handy is the trampoline. This is also for jumping and it is safer to have one that is secured on the sides with nets to prevent the children from falling off. These are also available locally and come in various sizes, most of them circular,\n",
    "but there are also rectangular ones. These should cost you about Sh.40,000 to Sh.60,000 each depending on the size. They are assembled and disassembled on site so carrying them around will be easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also have other play toys such as clowns, masks, balls, balloons, etc that the children can play with for a change. Since you may have several children showing up at the same time, a variety of play equipment may be necessary to keep them busy throughout since not all may have the time or even space to jump in the castles or trampolines at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your children’s entertainment business will require to be located in a place that is frequented by parents and their children such as a busy shopping mall or a shopping center.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also look for an empty yard that is clearly visible and easily accessible, probably located next to a busy road or center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other places where parents frequent over the weekends such as a car wash yards, recreation parks, major restaurants etc may also be ideal locations for your children’s entertainment business. You can also set up your business in an open space in your estate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach the management of the places such as a busy mall, shopping center, car wash or restaurant and request them to permit you to set up your temporary business within or next to their premises. It could be within or next to the car park or entrance of such a place, depending on the space available.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Operation*\n",
    "\n",
    "Having been granted permission by the management to set up within the mall, shopping center, restaurant compound, or wherever else you have settled on, it will be time to agree on the days you will be open for business. \n",
    "\n",
    "These would be mostly weekends, Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays will also be ideal as many children and their parents will be free. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your location and size of your main equipment, bouncing castle and trampoline, you may charge anything between Sh.50 and Sh.100 per hour of play. \n",

    "*Grace Adek*\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am not going back to formal employment,” Grace Adek says. She has been selling second-hand women’s clothes since she was a university student. \n",
    "\n",
    "“I would buy 30 extra dresses to sell to my schoolmates every time I went shopping for myself,” she says. “I would buy the dresses for Sh.50 to Sh.100, then sell them for Sh.500 to Sh.600 bob.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Four years ago she quit her job as a pharmaceuticals marketer to pursue her mitumba business fulltime. At the time, Grace had been dabbling in the business part-time while she worked her day job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, Grace purchases clothes worth hundreds of thousands a week. “Every week I buy stock worth between Sh.200,000 and Sh.300,000. I make a profit of between Sh.100,000 to Sh.150,000. I make Sh.20,000 on a good day and at least Sh.5,000 in a bad one.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, costs are low; Grace runs her business online so she has no rent to pay. She has a Facebook page with 29,000 likes, and it is where her customers shop. Besides two motorbikes and their drivers to deliver her orders, there are no other costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Christine Wanjiru*\n",
    "\n",
    "Christine Wanjiru had an entrepreneurial mind from her younger days. \"I had loved business since I was very young and so when I completed high school, I started hawking small perishable and non-perishable items before I joined college,\" explains Wanjiru.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"From the proceeds I made in my hawking business, I was able to cater for some of my basic needs thus lightening the financial burden and making it easier for my mum.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The mother of two studied Supply Chain Management and started a 'mitumba' (second hand clothes) business two and a half years ago. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"I had been working in a parastatal before resigning and venturing into my current business.” Today, she imports mitumba bales and together with her partner, Catherine Njeru, she is successfully running a business that puts food on the table and pays the bills.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it was not always smooth sailing. \"After college, I got my first job in a beauty parlour, where I worked for a short while before leaving to follow my heart. I started saving from the little I was making and saved enough money to start a business. \n",
    "\n",
    "I ventured into the business of selling men’s clothes, which made me travel to Kampala in Uganda twice a month,\" she explains. \"Life was all nice and cosy until I developed a spinal problem, which got me almost paralyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "After treatment, the doctor advised me to take it easy. I could no longer travel for long distances, which marked the end of my business,\" says Wanjiru. She later started looking for a job and that was how she landed one as a procurement officer at a parastatal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I worked in the procurement department but I did not feel like I was growing. It felt like I was caught up in a time warp. There was no challenge. My schedule was pretty much the same day in day out,\" explains Wanjiru. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"I would report to work, work on the local purchase orders (LPOs) on my desk and be done by 11am. No one really followed up on how we spent the remainder of the working hours and at 5pm, I would leave the office.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I felt wasted. I felt I could do more with all those hours as I hate wasting time,\" she narrates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wanjiru said she felt uncomfortable at how her colleagues seemed comfortable watching movies in the office not knowing they could be making more money out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"By the eighth month, I had decided I wasn't going to waste more time. Earlier, I had met a friend who worked in Gikomba market. She had told me about 'mitumba' bales,\" says Wanjiru. \n",
    "\n",
    "I had no idea about how to go about it but I was ready to learn, she says. After handing in her resignation letter, she went in search of her friend. \"My friend taught me how to go about it and I started off.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Wanjiru started buying and selling bales of mitumba clothes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Bales are usually well labelled depending on what's inside. Importing a container is quiet expensive and so I partnered with my friend, Catherine,\" she narrates. \"The container takes about two months to arrive and as we wait for our consignment, we source from other suppliers locally.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the new venture kicked off, Wanjiru realized it wasn't as rosy as she had hoped. \"It was hard getting customers in such a vast market and so I had to look for ways to survive,\" she says. \"I opted to open a Facebook page called - Grade 1 Mitumba Bales - for advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "It took time before picking but eventually we gained trust from our customers. We have never met 90 per cent of our customers but we operate on trust,\" explains Wanjiru. \n",
    "\n",
    "The clients send them money and their location and the ladies send them the bales, which they import from Canada. Since the duo sells the bales in wholesale, it is easier to dispose of them and import others.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a way of giving back to the society in their own small way, Wanjiru helps youth start their own businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"I usually enlist the assistance of my friends on social media, who help me identify needy young people with love for business. I then give them bales, which they pay for after they have sold. This helps to build them as they do not have to raise the capital to buy the bales in advance,\" she explains. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"We also advertise them on our social media pages and they are able to stay in the market,\" she says.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we even delve into the profitability of dragon fruit farming in Kenya, let us first explain what this thing is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dragon fruit, also called Pitaya, is a fruit that grows on a plant of the cactus family. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many varieties of the fruit, distinguishable by the colour of the fruit skin and flesh. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some have a red skin while others have a yellow one. The flesh can be red, purple or white. The red and purple fleshed dragon fruits are sweet while the white fleshed ones are a little sour.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why would it be wise to invest in dragon fruit farming in Kenya now? \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "*1) Dragon fruits are easy to grow*\n",
    "\n",
    "New plants are easily grown from cuttings. All you need to do is obtain cuttings from a mature vine, keep them under a shade to dry off their tips for about a week and then plant them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cuttings are planted by burying the lower tip (just about 1 inch) into the soil. \n",
    "\n",
    "In about 2 weeks the cuttings start developing roots and new shoots appear in about a month’s time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Better still, you can buy already rooted and sprouting dragon fruit seedlings from Richfarm Kenya (0724698357). They take 9 months to 1 year to start producing fruits.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Being in the cactus family, dragon fruit plants do not need a lot of water. They are best planted in sandy or loamy soils that are well drained. \n",
    "\n",
    "After planting them, they will need very little attention other than the occasional application of manure and pruning. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are less susceptible to pests and diseases so you won’t have the burden of spraying them regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2) High returns on investment*\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitaya is among the most expensive fruits in Kenya at the moment with a kilo selling for between Ksh.800 and Ksh.1,200. \n",
    "\n",
    "The farmers that are already harvesting in Kenya produce fruits that have between 400g and 1.2kg. The cuttings used in planting cost only Ksh.500 each. \n",
    "\n",
    "So essentially, selling just 1 fruit will help you recoup the investment you put in buying planting materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dragon fruit plants are vines that have a production period of up to 30 years. So you will need to support them with strong posts that can last as long. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each vine can grow up to 30 feet long and give you 30 to 100 fruits per year upon maturity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can see what that means in terms of returns given the current prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The demand for these fruits is very high in Kenya especially among the Asian communities. In fact, anyone who has tasted this fruit likes it. The only limiting factor at the moment is the high price. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have a high production capacity, you can reach a very wide market by reducing your prices and still make a kill. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not forget that the export market in China, the Middle East and Europe is also offering very high prices for dragon fruit. These markets would definitely prefer the high quality fruits grown in our hot tropical climate to the less tasty fruits from sub-tropical regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3) They require a small space*\n",
    "\n",
    "Dragon fruit vines are planted in groups supported by one post. On each post, you can plant 4 vines. The ideal spacing is 1m from one group to the next and 2m between the rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this kind of spacing you can fit 1,000 dragon fruit plants on a plot 50 by 100. This is enough to help you realize a good economic return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the vines do not have deep roots, some farmers even plant them on pots in their backyard gardens. This is an ideal way to grow dragon fruits for your own consumption even if you live in a rented house in which you only have a balcony.\n",
    "\n",
    "*So how do I start a dragon fruit farm in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a plot of land, anything from a 50 by 100 or bigger, you can easily start this kind of commercial farming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dragon fruits grow well in areas with temperatures of 15℃ and above. They also like full day sunshine, therefore ensure that you do not plant them under trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have your land cleared and set up the support structures that will hold your plants. These structures are made with strong posts of about 5 feet and an old tyre mounted on each post. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other farmers construct a square wooden structure on the poles. These are the structures over which the vines will hang.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare the base area of each post to have fine soils. Mix the soil with manure: chicken manure is the best for growing Pitaya. Plant your seedlings here making sure not to cover too much of the stem to avoid rotting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use strings to train the vines onto the post. If the weather becomes too hot and dry, water your plants for faster growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wait to start harvesting the precious fruit in about a year’s time. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to get more information on dragon fruit farming in Kenya, call Richfarm Kenya on 0724698357. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We always encourage the youth to inculcate a strong saving and investment culture so that they can get the capital and will-power to innovate and launch new businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we asked Mr. Karanja’s (one of our team members) to expound on how he would invest a starting capital of Ksh.100,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "And although his strategy is not 100% fool-proof, we believe there is a lot in it for you to LEARN, CONNECT & GROW.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Invest In A SACCO*\n",
    " \n",
    "If I had Ksh.100,000 today, I would first join a SACCO (e.g. Waumini Sacco or Unaitas) where I would save half of that amount split into small installments over a period of 10 months. \n",
    "\n",
    "This would ensure that before the year ends I have enough capital back-up somewhere to power my business. \n",
    "\n",
    "My decision to invest in a SACCO is informed by the fact that most such organizations are willing to lend one up to 6 times their savings provided you have saved for at least 6 months with them.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Do a Feasibility Study*\n",
    " \n",
    "Given that I would still have the other Ksh.50,000 with me, I would spend at least 2 months doing a feasibility study. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would compare many different ideas and go to the ground to ascertain their practicality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, I would do market research and even initiate a professional relationship with potential buyers of my products so that I have a reliable foundation by the time I set foot into the waters.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Start Investing*\n",
    " \n",
    "Given that I know one or two things about farming, I would certainly think about venturing into agri-business. \n",
    "\n",
    "My focus would be on land around a major city such as Nairobi or Thika. There are many rural areas in places like Murang’a, Fly Over, Kijabe, Isinya, Narok, Naivasha or even Githunguri where one can lease a small piece of land for a short period of time.\n",
    " \n",
    "Particularly I would look for a place where they lease a half an acre or quarter acre at Ksh.10,000 or thereabout per year. This should preferably not be too far from the road (or at least accessible on a motorbike).\n",
    " \n",
    "I would also spend another Ksh.10,000 for expert advice, travel and other related expenses.\n",
    " \n",
    "For now I am yet to choose between strawberry farming, red onion farming, garlic farming and tomato farming but I am sure a feasibility study would help me make an informed decision. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let’s say I would choose red onion farming.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Get Moving*\n",
    " \n",
    "Now that I have leased land, paid for expert advice and done a feasibility study I would go ahead and start preparing to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "This involves tilling the land, acquiring seedlings, fertilizer and other requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "This would also be the ideal time to request for a loan from my SACCO which hopefully will be Ksh.50,000 × 6 = Ksh.300,000.\n",
    " \n",
    "This would be enough to maximize on the productivity of the farm. For instance, I would think of investing in a green-house, aquaponics system and a water tank to ensure steady supply of water to my farm.\n",
    " \n",
    "Or still, I would invest in a small motorbike which costs Ksh.100,000. Not to forget marketing and branding which I estimate could cost me around Ksh.20,000 minimum.\n",
    " \n",
    "It is also prudent to prepare for a rainy day so I would set aside Ksh.80,000 as backup capital.\n",
    " \n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    " \n",
    "Most of the crops that I would focus on will take 3 to 5 months to mature. \n",
    "\n",
    "But to be realistic the first harvesting season is always a learning experience. It’s normal to make mistakes in business so for starters I would work to achieve stability by re-investing whatever profits I get. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, within a year after starting the farm I will have repaid the SACCO loan and the beautiful farm will be 100% mine.\n",
    " \n",
    "What are your thoughts about Mr. Karanja’s investment strategy? In your opinion which strategy would you use to invest your Ksh.100,000?\n",

    "\n",
    "The time you spend in your 20s is perhaps the most crucial to your development as a person. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you are just getting started in business and are dreaming of becoming a renowned entrepreneur someday. Or you are just settling down in your dream career.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem? There is no manual to help guide you through this tumultuous time and you might end up regretting for not having done the right things at the right time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(1) NOT PERSEVERING WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH*\n",
    "\n",
    "Life has never and will never be a bed of roses and you need to persevere if you want to go far. Don’t give up simply because your first investment did not materialize as you had planned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t despair simply because you lost your first ever contract. You need to be a person with a strong heart and mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the old saying goes: “A hero is an ordinary individual who finds strength in persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles” – Chris Reeve\n",
    "\n",
    "*(2) NOT TAKING RISKS*\n",
    "\n",
    "Risks are a part of everyday life. In fact, everything you do is a risk in one way or another. For example when you go to school you risk failing in your exams. When you marry you risk divorce.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are alive you risk dying. When you go to sleep, you risk not waking up the next morning to go to work. So, appreciate the fact that you have to take risks if you want to succeed in life…and start taking risks at a young age.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a quote that goes: “A person who risks nothing does nothing, has nothing and dies with nothing” – Leo F.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(3) NOT SAVING*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you make an effort to save even if it is just a small amount of cash once a month. The earlier you start saving the smoother your sunset years will get and the lesser the strain you will undergo when you get older.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, as you grow old, you have more responsibilities to handle – from taking your children to school to paying hefty medical bills due to deteriorating health… so start adding to your kitty right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful quote: “Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving.” – Warren Buffet\n",
    "\n",
    "*(4) NOT RESEARCHING BEFORE INVESTING*\n",
    "\n",
    "Everybody is telling you to start investing at a young age. Others us are busy telling you to start taking risks while you are still young. Your parents are busy telling you to buy a plot of land so that you can start a home. Your colleagues are pressuring you to buy your first car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you know what? You have got to always research before investing your time and financial resources. You don’t have to start doing things simply because others are doing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t have to buy a car simply because everyone at your workplace is driving one. Always make sober decisions that are based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is beneficial to you now and in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "*What you can comfortably afford\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Tip: You can hardly go wrong if you invest in assets that gains value over time e.g. land and stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(5) NOT KEEPING FIT*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your metabolism rate tends to decline as you grow older and older. Likewise, your body strength and muscular power diminishes with time and that is why you tend to grow fatter in between the ages of 30 and 45.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that you age gracefully, with minimal health concerns and with the right body-size, start exercising early.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting Point To Note: Eat well, workout hard, live long.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(6) NOT MAINTAINING QUALITY CONNECTIONS*\n",
    "\n",
    "What are connections? A connection is anyone you have gone to school with, worked with… simply anyone who knows you really well. Now, one mistake you are likely to make is to lose useful connections in your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just because you have gotten a new job does not mean that you burn bridges with former colleagues. Likewise, just because your business is thriving does not mean you forget about those who mentored you all along.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Point To Note: Everyone you come across in life is important in one way or another. Even the bad people are good – in that they teach you how to survive against all odds.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(7) NOT BEING DISCIPLINED*\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for discipline does not end when you leave campus. Discipline actually supersedes everything else in life. You need to be disciplined in your business so that you can draw a clear line between business hours and social hours. You need discipline in order to make long-term decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need discipline to handle clients’ money without being tempted to misappropriate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wise Words: “Discipline is doing what needs to be done even when you don’t feel like it.” – Stephen Luke\n",
    "\n",
    "*(8) NOT BEING SURE WHAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE WITH YOUR LIFE*\n",
    "\n",
    "Discovering what you really want to do with your life is not an easy task for anyone… nor is it something you can really be trained on. All the same, you need to start pinpointing what you want from your future – and the earlier you start doing this; the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, “I want to empower at least 10 youngsters before I hit 50” or “I want to be the man to end the error of jiggers infestation in my village” and so forth. – The earlier you discover your purpose in life, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Quote: “There is more to life than just living.” – Ashok Kallarakal\n",
    "\n",
    "*FINAL WORD*\n",
    "\n",
    "They say that your 20s are for “defining” and your 30s are for “refining”. So here is a quick takeaway – No matter where you are today, it is never too late to learn from your past and forge the way forward.\n",

    "\n",
    "Petrol station business is regarded as one of the profitable business to start in both Africa and worldwide. This is due to the increasing numbers of people who own cars. Many people are now purchasing cars due to the existence of cheap cars. The cheapest cars even go up to less than a million Kenyan Shillings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a petrol station business, is one of the sure way of earning maximum profits. This is what they say, \"Make money while sleeping\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a petrol station business in Kenya, or any country is highly capital intensive but very profitable in the long run. \n",
    "\n",
    "By capital intensive, we are talking about an initial cost of over Ksh.8 Million to set up and run a fully operational petrol station. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of factors to put under consideration before venturing into the petrol station business in Kenya. An ideal business plan needs to be formulated before anything else. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the factors to consider in the business plan include;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Land\n",
    "*Capital\n",
    "*Licenses\n",
    "*Fuel suppliers\n",
    "*Petrol station business setup\n",
    "*Pieces of equipment for the Station\n",
    "*Insurance cover(s)\n",
    "*Fuel prices\n",
    "*Revenues and marketing\n",
    "*Employee workforce\n",
    "*Vehicle services\n",
    "*Competition from other stations\n",
    "\n",
    "The list is long, however, these are some of the few major factors one ought to factor in before investing rightly so into the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Land*\n",
    "\n",
    "Land plays an important role, in determining how much profits one will earn from the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to buy/rent/lease land for the sole purpose of constructing a petrol station. However, buying the land is the better option as the fuel proceeds will translate to higher marginal profits in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that for a petrol station business to flourish, it has to be near the main road or a junction where it can serve many motorists. This is the geographical aspect to consider in establishing a petrol station.\n",
    "\n",
    "The land’s topography should also be looked at. One cannot set up a petrol station business with the land sloping. The land has to be flat. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the underground fuel tank that has to be put in place. The storage tanks are buried underground and their sizes determine how many thousands of liters of fuel can be stored, and how many different grades of fuel, whether petrol, diesel and/or kerosene.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Capital*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the land has been identified and all legal relevant paperwork obtained showing land ownership then comes the financial planning part. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Kenya, the cost of establishing a petrol station ranges between Ksh.8 million to Ksh.15 million. One constructs a petrol station according to their preference and how they deem fit appearance-wise but it has to meet certain set standards otherwise the business venture will fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other than the petrol station, one could establish a side business such as a building with numerous shops, a shopping avenue such as a mini-mall, or an eatery, like most petrol stations do so in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Licenses*\n",
    "\n",
    "For one to legally operate a fuel station in any country, they must have all the necessary business permits from various organizations and agencies, fuel and government-related of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business will be deemed as registered if there is a business permit, a fire permit license and a health permit license. \n",
    "\n",
    "A business permit in Kenya costs Ksh.15,000 depending on the nature of the business. When applying for a business permit in Kenya, it is important to take note of the following required documents;\n",
    "\n",
    "*A registered business name\n",
    "\n",
    "*The physical address of the business\n",
    "\n",
    "*A copy of the certificate of incorporation\n",
    "\n",
    "*A copy of National ID/ Passport/ Alien ID\n",
    "\n",
    "*Business ID number\n",
    "\n",
    "*An inspection document by the ward licensing officer determines the licensing fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fire permit costs Ksh.5,000 to obtain.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Petrol Station Business setup*\n",
    "\n",
    "The appearance of the petrol station is very important in luring motorists to one’s station. Proper planning and construction are important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Laying down bricks on the ground rather than leaving the bare soil exposed always has a psychological impact on the driving motorists. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lighting is also a factor to consider as the petrol station needs to be well-lit, especially during the night.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of fuel pumping stations is important too but more fuel pumps mean more capital invested.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, aside from the petrol station business, it is also a very good idea to construct a building which can be rented/leased out as this helps improve the businesses profits, not just depending on the petrol station alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Equipment for the petrol station.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The pumping machines in a petrol station are quite expensive. There are several types of fuel dispensers on the market however the recommended dispensers are;\n",
    "\n",
    "*Intelligent Multi-media fuel dispenser\n",
    "\n",
    "*CS20 Series Fuel Dispenser\n",
    "\n",
    "*T Man Series Fuel Dispenser\n",
    "\n",
    "*Marve Series Fuel Dispenser\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pioneer Series Fuel Dispenser\n",
    "\n",
    "*CS46-Legend Fuel Dispenser\n",
    "\n",
    "*CS46-Classic Series Fuel Dispenser\n",
    "\n",
    "*CS42-Legend Fuel Dispenser.\n",
    "\n",
    "*X-Man Series Fuel Dispenser\n",
    "\n",
    "*RT-HY224 Fuel Dispenser with LED\n",
    "\n",
    "The fuel pump prices are different depending on the types of fuel they pump;\n",
    "\n",
    "Duo Nozzle – Ksh.480,000 and above per unit\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Nozzle – Ksh.270,000 and above per unit\n",
    "\n",
    "Twin Nozzle (Both Petrol and Diesel) – Ksh.480,000 and above per unit\n",
    "\n",
    "Take note that an underground tank is important to construct before laying the foundation for the petrol station.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fuel suppliers*\n",
    "\n",
    "After the construction of the station, it is vital to reach out to at least three different fuel suppliers who shall be restocking your petrol station with fuel when the underground tank starts to run dry. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is also important to get into business with trusted and reputable fuel suppliers who will supply the correct quantity and quality, according to how much comes from your pocket. \n",
    "\n",
    "Be wary of some suppliers who mix fuel/ supply low amounts/poor quality fuel all for malicious gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Obtain Insurance cover.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance is very important in case a lethal crisis befalls your petrol station premises. One should choose a policy in which the risk of the policy occurring is potentially high as compared to other risk policies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fire cover is mandatory as well as an accident cover. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a total cover package called Petrol Station insurance/ forecourt insurance/ fuel station cover/ petroleum retail and convenience insurance/ filling station insurance. \n",
    "\n",
    "This covers all the risks associated with the petrol station be it fire, accidents, injuries while at the station, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Revenues and marketing*\n",
    "\n",
    "After establishing the business, one can begin marketing the petrol station. The best way to market oil currently in Kenya is by giving promotions and offers such as discounts. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is sure to get more customers after the spike in fuel prices with the subsidy struggling to keep the prices low. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other marketing options include social media advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business will do well provided that the station provides quality fuel and good services hence an increase in revenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "On average, a mini-petrol station that operates daily with frequent customers can earn an annual profit of about Ksh.9,000,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Employee workforce*\n",
    "\n",
    "The petrol station attendants working at a petrol station have a great influence on how the business will succeed. \n",
    "\n",
    "There must always be employees on standby near the fuel pumps waiting for vehicles to arrive and fuel in the station. Otherwise, motorists may assume that there is no fuel in the station and the place is deserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attendants also have to be courteous and respectful to the motorists. They ought to learn how to serve customers well, as this not only builds a good reputation for the petrol station but it also increases the numbers of new customers and loyal customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "They should avoid trouble with motorists as this will not only drive customers away, but they may also end up losing their jobs in the long run. \n",
    "\n",
    "Attendants can show their value to the customers by offering to check accessories in the vehicle’s hood such as the engine oil, coolant and the transmission fluid and wiping clean the windshields\n",
    "\n",
    "*Vehicle services*\n",
    "\n",
    "Other vehicle services that are optional to have in the petrol station premises are car washing services, car servicing, wheel alignment and a Tire center. \n",
    "\n",
    "These days, it is very common to find that most petrol stations have air pressure for the wheels and in the spirit of competition, it would be good to have one.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Thoughts*\n",
    "\n",
    "Is a petrol station a good business to invest in? \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the number of motorists on the road daily; they need fuel for their car engines to travel and they get their fuel from somewhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "With strategic planning, a petrol station can very easily make one a multi-millionaire as I will show you in Part 2 of this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t miss out on part 2 of this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, don`t forget to join our upcoming training on Mitumba Business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitumba is a Kenyan name for second-hand items, clothes, handbags, school bags, and shoes. A mitumba business is one of the most lucrative businesses you can start with little capital. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sale of mitumba has changed many people’s lives, especially the youth who fail to secure formal employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle-class Kenyans refer to second-hand products as “okoa jahazi” since they are quite affordable and budget-friendly. All you need to do is play your cards right.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most people shy away from venturing into mitumba business thinking it is saturated. The truth is, it is so much profitable. Even with just Ksh.1,000, you can start a small-scale mitumba business and at the end of the day, you will get at least Ksh.500 profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is much better than staying at home doing nothing or waiting for someone to notice your application letter on their desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am not going back to formal employment,” Grace Adek says. She has been selling second-hand women’s clothes since she was a university student. \n",
    "\n",
    "“I would buy 30 extra dresses to sell to my schoolmates every time I went shopping for myself,” she says. “I would buy the dresses for Sh.50 to Sh.200, then sell them for Sh.300 to Sh.600 bob.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Four years ago she quit her job as a pharmaceuticals marketer to pursue her mitumba business fulltime. At the time, Grace had been dabbling in the business part-time while she worked her day job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you can start small in this business, but think big. You can start as a retailer of single mitumba items, grow to a wholesalers of bales and eventually an importer of a container or containers full of mitumba bales.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the right knowledge, proper pricing and marketing that we shall teach you in our Mitumba Business Training, the sky is the limit.\n",

    "\n",
    "Kenya boasts more than 70 oil marketing and importing companies, though most people know ‘the big five’.\n",
    "\n",
    "These companies are Gulf African Petroleum Corporation, Total Kenya, Vivo Energy, Libya Oil Kenya and KenolKobil.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you will agree that it would take quite a bit of courage and a healthy sense of risk to decide to play in this arena as a young businessman.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that’s exactly what Simon Kirima of Awali Group is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Awali Group is an oil marketing company that owns seven independent petrol stations nationwide and three dealerships, and supplies fuel to independent fuel stations, hotels, hospitals and other industrial outfits.\n",
    "\n",
    "I met with Simon who took me through the journey that’s built him a multi-million-shilling business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What does an oil marketing company do exactly?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, an oil marketing company is one that imports oil into a country, usually regulated by government tenders, and then resells the oil to other oil companies or institutions at a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It’s been said that the oil industry is a closed industry, why?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason is the high capital investment needed, coupled with the high-risk factor due to stiff competition and potential for losses in daily operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much capital did you put into your business starting out?*\n",
    "\n",
    "My path into the oil industry started in 2013 with a petrol station. My start-up capital was Sh.7 million, which I recouped within two years, and I acquired three more stations in this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Take us through how you got to the point where you could raise Sh.7 million. What’s your background?*\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s something I don’t like talking about because my life as a young man was messy. I grew up in Ruai, Eastlands. My parents were business people, so we didn’t struggle for finances but many of my peers did. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think because my mind couldn’t come to terms with that, I ended up rebelling against the system. I got into a lot of trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was admitted into one of the top national schools, but I had difficulties following all the rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "My mother gave me a rosary and told me that no matter how much I rebelled, God would never give up on me. \n",
    "\n",
    "Her acceptance of who I was made me realise I wanted to be more and do better, for her. So I did.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How did you end up in oil?*\n",
    "\n",
    "After university, in 2003, I joined the banking industry. Ten years later, in the run-up to the 2013 elections, I decided to go into politics. \n",
    "\n",
    "I took leave from work to campaign and lost. I hadn’t informed my employer about my intentions but they found out, so when I got back to work, I was demoted. \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to quit the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time I was earning Sh.400,000 a month, but I had spent more than Sh.3 million during the elections. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "A friend approached me with a proposal to go into the oil business and I jumped at the opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*So how did you raise Sh.7 million?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ironically, I used my networks in the banking industry and borrowed against property, including the home I was living in. One of my good friends and business partners also used his own house as security for financing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*That was quite a risk, considering you were new to the industry.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, which is also what pushed me to succeed. I remember starting from the very bottom because I wanted to learn the ropes. \n",
    "\n",
    "My first eight months I worked as a pump attendant at my own station – the employees had no idea who I was.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What are some of the lessons you learned from your staff?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This will sound funny, but they taught me how to steal – from oil deliveries and from the cash register.\n",
    "\n",
    "I played along because, unknown to them, they were revealing the loopholes in the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "You lose oil at the depot because of the cartels involved, you lose oil in the trucks because the drivers siphon it enroute, you lose oil when it arrives at the station because what is recorded is different from the actual amounts delivered, and you lose oil on sales due to theft from attendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is there a solution for this?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried many options. For instance, there was a time I decided to follow a truck whose driver I suspected was stealing from me. \n",
    "\n",
    "I tracked him to a plot in Nairobi’s Industrial Area, but I was shot at by unknown characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "That was one of the scariest moments in my life.\n",
    "\n",
    "I reported the matter to the police but nothing came of it. That’s when I decided I couldn’t fight these thieves physically, but I could thwart them with technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What kind of technology are we talking about?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I partnered with a friend from high school who ran a company called Empire Microsystems, which deals in automating oil distribution from depot to customer, using intelligent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chip is embedded into every carrier of fuel from the tanks in the depot, the trucks transporting the fuel, the tanks at the stations and the fuel pumps.\n",
    "\n",
    "These chips digitally record the volume of fuel passing through these carriers and remit the information to our head office.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means we know exactly how many litres left the depot, how many litres are in the truck, how many litres are deposited into our station tanks, and how many litres are sold to customers. In case of loss, we can accurately trace where it occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Has it worked in reducing your losses?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Many fuel stations and oil marketing companies will record a loss of 4 per cent, while the acceptable rate of loss is 0.5 per cent to maximise on profits. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are currently at 0.2 per cent using our intelligent stations and depot system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has helped us maximise our returns to the point where we could raise Sh.120 million to become an oil marketing company.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Is this system exclusive to your stations?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our individualised system is, yes, but we are in talks with some of the big companies to automate their oil distribution, including intelligent depots.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How much does it take to buy and implement this technology?*\n",
    "\n",
    "To digitise a station would cost approximately Sh.3 million. To digitise a depot would depend on the size of the depot, but would cost approximately Sh.20 million – this would include putting a weighbridge solution that weighs trucks as they enter and exit the depot.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You went from owning one fuel station to being an oil marketing company, to seeking to revolutionise how oil is distributed in this country. What do you think is behind all your success?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the gaps, and being a part of the solution. It’s really that simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just because something has always been done in a certain way doesn’t make it the best method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Always change, always find a better way.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "Petrol station business are usually more profitable when you place the business near busy roads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start it is advisable to do a feasibility study. If the math sound right and if you spot a gap in your area then you can go for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, nothing good comes on a silver platter. Start small and dream big.\n",

    " \n",
    "Are you at a time in your business when it feels like you have hit a ceiling?\n",
    "\n",
    "You are about to learn how to grow your business again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some businesses grow up to a certain level and then just stop. In such circumstances, you may notice that your sales are not increasing; no matter how hard you try.\n",
    "\n",
    "This often doesn’t mean there is something wrong with your business; you just need to think differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists and marketing experts like to call it ‘market saturation’, a term which means that the demand and potential customers for your products or services may have reached their limits within your area.\n",
    "So, how can you get out of this ugly situation?\n",
    "\n",
    "This article reveals three tried and tested strategies you can apply to break through the ceiling, double or triple your sales and grow your business again.\n",
    "\n",
    "I shall also share a real life example of a local business (owned by a friend) that has successfully used two of these strategies to increase its sales and return the business to a growth path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you are comfortable with the current size of your business and don’t plan to grow it any further, you would love this article!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever find your business in a situation where you need to increase your sales and grow your business, here are a few options you will need to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Option 1 – Sell more of your current products and services to your existing customers*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there are ways you can squeeze out more money from your existing customers by offering juicy offers that make them want to buy more of your products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing experts like to call this a ‘market penetration’ or ‘concentrated growth’ strategy.’ Fortunately, I prefer to stick to simpler words that most people can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your existing customers are the reason why your business has grown to the size that it is. These people come to buy from you because your products satisfy their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a high influence over your existing customers because they may already trust and like you. It’s many times easier to sell to an existing customer than to another person who has never bought your products or enjoyed your services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is, most small business owners often take their existing customers for granted and only focus on attracting new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can you make your existing customers buy more? How can you use your influence over your customers to sell them more products and increase your sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at one very interesting strategy you can use to achieve this. It’s simple and very effective, yet it is often overlooked by many businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Loyalty Programs*\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a friend (let’s call her Matilda) who took my advice and implemented a loyalty program for her beauty salon business.\n",

    "Loyalty programs usually work best with businesses that have repeat customers. And a beauty salon totally fits that category because people will often visit a salon to have a makeover or haircut about once or twice a month (depending on customer preferences).\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the loyalty program worked for my friend was quite simple. First, customers had to register for the program to allow them enjoy the benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "After registration, any money spent by a customer adds up to his or her ‘loyalty points’. When these points reach certain levels, the customer enjoys special discounts on all services in the salon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more money customers spent in the salon, the higher their loyalty points rose allowing them to enjoy even higher discounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "What was the effect? Amazing! Customers started to bring their friends along to the salon and referred neighbours and colleagues because any money they spent would help to increase their loyalty points. This led to more sales for my friend’s salon business and enjoyable discounts for the customers. Everybody wins!\n",
    "\n",
    "Loyalty programs are a good way to further generate your customers’ interest in your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give them a reason to become your ambassadors and advertise your business. Rather than spend money on advertising that may yield poor results, why not recruit the people who already use your products and services to spread the word about your business?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your existing customers can help to grow your business if you give them a reason to. Find an interesting way to cultivate a loyal following with your existing customers and you will be amazed at the results!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Option 2 – Sell new products and services to your existing customers*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you have a business that sells women’s shoes. Fortunately, you have a steady stream of loyal customers who love to buy your shoes because they are high quality, fashionable and you treat your customers well.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there’s a limit to the number of shoes a single customer can buy. Are there other ways to make more money from your loyal customer base of shoe buyers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there is!\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about new products that are similar to the things you are already selling and sell them to your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Women don’t just need shoes. They also need handbags, clothing, lingerie (underwear), wrist watches, bracelets and several other accessories.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, they buy these other stuff you don’t sell from other businesses around you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they are already loyal to you, these customers would gladly buy all these other stuff from you if only you sold them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than remain a shoe-selling business, you can expand your business by offering products that belong to the same category as the product you are currently selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you have a loyal customer base, you can become a “women’s clothing accessories business” rather than a “women’s shoe business.”\n",
    "\n",
    "When Matilda opened her beauty salon business, she only provided hairdressing services for women. But women don’t just want to make their hair look good. They want other things too!\n",
    "\n",
    "Matilda noticed the opportunity to introduce new services that her customers would gladly pay for. She introduced new and related services like manicure, pedicure, facial therapy, nail treatments and several others.\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing these new services, she transformed her business from an ordinary ‘hairdressing salon business’ into a ‘personal care and beauty salon business’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Matilda, to succeed with this strategy, you need to think of other products that your existing customers usually use in addition to your product/service. Instead of single products, think in terms of product categories. What other products will your existing customers be interested in and would happily purchase?\n",
    "\n",
    "These new products or services will give a new boost to your sales and you would have accomplished this by selling to people who already buy from you – your existing customers!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Option 3 – Sell your current products to NEW customers*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day, we are exposed to adverts in newspapers and magazines. We listen to advertising jingles on the radio and watch commercials on television. These types of adverts are like casting fishing nets into a wide ocean and hoping to catch something.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you may catch something but it’s not always the best use of your advertising time, effort and money. How can you be sure that the people who read, heard or watched the adverts will be interested in the product?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many businesses in Africa are usually limited by their physical location.\n",
    "There are products that already sell well in one city, town or village and will likely sell a whole lot more if they can be introduced to other locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your business stops growing, it may be that there are no more customers within your area or physical location. At that point, your target market may have reached its limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this situation, the only way to increase your sales and continue to grow the business is to find new customers. So, how can you find new customers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few ideas…\n",
    "\n",
    "*Spread out!*\n",
    "\n",
    "By spreading out, I mean you should look for ways to expand your products or services beyond your current location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a branch or new shop in another part of town.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simpler option is to find distributors/sellers for your products outside your present location. Introduce your product to them and use them as a channel to sell these products to new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the big companies love to use this strategy. Every day, new products are coming into Africa from overseas businesses because they see our continent as a source of huge growth for their businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their home markets are saturated and competition is often quite tight. To grow their businesses, these companies look for new markets with a fresh supply of customers and Africa meets these requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicles, food products, construction materials and more are increasingly imported from North America, Europe and Asia. Why are these busineses desperate to sell their products and services to Africans? The answer is to grow their sales and expand business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get online*\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet has changed the way we do business in today’s modern world. A business that would have been totally invisible to the outside world can now be found by people across the world via the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet has broken down the physical barriers that used to limit the growth of local businesses. With a simple Facebook Page, Instagram account, Whatsapp group or your own business website, you too can put your products and services in front of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s simple, cheap and relatively effortless! Get your business phone number out there. You never can tell who could contact you for business.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had a bead jewelry business, how would you normally sell your beautiful finished products to make money? Friends, family and neighbours right? If you are lucky, you could rent a shop in an open part of your city or town and sell a few hundred bead necklaces and bracelets every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "But by creating a presence on the internet and showcasing your products online, you would automatically have access to millions (yes millions) of potential customers for your beautiful bead jewelry.\n",
    "\n",
    "And what would it cost you to have access to such a huge potential customer base in today’s world? Little or nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Facebook page for example is free to set up and can expose your business to a huge global market that would have been impossible for you to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the internet, your potential customers are no longer limited to friends, family, neighbours and other people in your physical environment. You too can now sell to people in the USA, Europe and Far East Asia.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Now you know how to grow your business. It’s time to test these strategies!*\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple strategies I have shared with you in this article are part of the ‘Ansoff Product/Market Matrix’, a framework that is commonly taught (as part of corporate strategy) in University and business schools around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix is also widely used by marketing experts and business owners who are looking for new ways to grow their business.\n",
    "\n",
    "If big businesses already enjoy the benefits of applying these tried and tested strategies to growing their businesses, I wonder why small businesses shouldn’t do the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already own a business (or plan to own one) but you are concerned about growing your business, these strategies will surely help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don't forget to join our training on Mitumba Business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitumba is a Kenyan name for second-hand items, clothes, handbags, school bags, and shoes. A mitumba business is one of the most lucrative businesses you can start with little capital. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sale of mitumba has changed many people’s lives, especially the youth who fail to secure formal employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle-class Kenyans refer to second-hand products as “okoa jahazi” since they are quite affordable and budget-friendly. All you need to do is play your cards right.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most people shy away from venturing into mitumba business thinking it is saturated. The truth is, it is so much profitable. Even with just Ksh.1,000, you can start a small-scale mitumba business and at the end of the day, you will get at least Ksh.500 profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is much better than staying at home doing nothing or waiting for someone to notice your application letter on their desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am not going back to formal employment,” Grace Adek says. She has been selling second-hand women’s clothes since she was a university student. \n",
    "\n",
    "“I would buy 30 extra dresses to sell to my schoolmates every time I went shopping for myself,” she says. “I would buy the dresses for Sh.50 to Sh.200, then sell them for Sh.300 to Sh.600 bob.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Four years ago she quit her job as a pharmaceuticals marketer to pursue her mitumba business fulltime. At the time, Grace had been dabbling in the business part-time while she worked her day job.\n",

    "\n",
    "Farmers in Kenya are increasingly becoming smart in identifying innovative ventures to earn a living thanks to the training that enables them to identify new agribusiness opportunities that have high returns with fewer investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among them are potato farmers. While a majority of them are growing the second basic crop for consumers, there are those who have identified a cash cow in seed multiplication for fellow producers.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Ministry of Agriculture, to date, the country has a capacity of producing 6,700 metric tonnes of potato seeds to farmers against the demand of 30,000 metric tons annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Richard Mbaria, a farmer from Elbagon in Molo Nakuru County is one of such farmers who has identified the gap and is currently investing in multiplying the planting materials for other farmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Richard started agribusiness after five years of growing maize and beans for subsistence purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, beginning mid last year, he decided to venture into commercial potato production on a quarter an acre by investing Sh.20,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first season, he harvested 30 bags of 100kg which he sold at Sh.2,000 per bag, in the second season he increases the acreage under the crop to 1.5 acres and harvested 100 bags of the same measure which he sold at Sh.1,500 each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this encouraged him, he says that there are high price fluctuations as the market is still dictated by brokers and therefore, he has decided to venture into seed multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I will now be selling the seeds to farmers directly avoiding middlemen who scoop much of our profit. I will also be cutting the production cost for the farmers who have to travel all the way to Naivasha to buy the seeds,” said Richard.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this, he invested only Sh.1,500 to buy 150 tissue culture seedlings of Sangi variety from Stockman Rozen Ltd, a seed production company in Naivasha at Sh.10 each.\n",
    "\n",
    "By involving Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS) for certification purposes to ensure that his area of production is free from pests and diseases, he has planted the seedlings expecting to harvest his first bunch.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am targeting farmers who want to start planting with the onset of the long rains because most of the farmers around are still depending on rainfed agriculture,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "He looks forward to harvesting between 50 and 80 bags of 50kg each of potato seeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to his little market research, KEPHIS certified seeds sell at Sh.100 per kilo but he may sell his at Sh.80 per kilo which may earn him at least Sh.200,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2012 KEPHIS has developed 51 varieties of potato seeds to boost production with 33 from Dutch breeding companies, 17 varieties from Kenyan breeders, and one from Scotland with imports of 602,450kg of seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reports by the Alliance for a Green Revolution (AGRA) states that in Africa only 20 per cent of the potato farmers use quality and certified planting materials, which has been dwindling yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for Richard, he is happy that the over 200 farmers whom he works with within the region will have better seedlings by the onset of the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "He is one of those farmers who have undergone the Farm to Market Alliance training program by Kuza Biashara in collaboration with Cereal Growers Association (CGA) something which has turned him into an Agribusiness Advisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "“With this new venture we are looking into producing quality and quantity potatoes for bigger companies shortly and be able to avoid brokers completely,” said Richard.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now more than ever is the time to be unique. Be different from the others. Think differently. Come up with new/innovative ideas in business.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't keep on doing things the same way everyone is doing it and expect different results. It's time to think outside the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agribusiness is the new cash cow especially for the unemployed youths. It's time to venture into agribusiness and do it differently from how everyone does it.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this group we are going to train and teach you for 22 days on how you can start, grow and profit from Mitumba Business in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitumba is a Kenyan name for second-hand items, clothes, handbags, school bags, and shoes. A mitumba business is one of the most lucrative businesses you can start with little capital. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sale of mitumba has changed many people’s lives, especially the youth who fail to secure formal employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle-class Kenyans refer to second-hand products as “okoa jahazi” since they are quite affordable and budget-friendly. All you need to do is play your cards right.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most people shy away from venturing into mitumba business thinking it is saturated. The truth is, it is so much profitable. Even with just Ksh.1,000, you can start a small-scale mitumba business and at the end of the day, you will get at least Ksh.500 profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is much better than staying at home doing nothing or waiting for someone to notice your application letter on their desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am not going back to formal employment,” Grace Adek says. She has been selling second-hand women’s clothes since she was a university student. \n",
    "\n",
    "“I would buy 30 extra dresses to sell to my schoolmates every time I went shopping for myself,” she says. “I would buy the dresses for Sh.50 to Sh.200, then sell them for Sh.300 to Sh.600 bob.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Four years ago she quit her job as a pharmaceuticals marketer to pursue her mitumba business fulltime. At the time, Grace had been dabbling in the business part-time while she worked her day job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you can start small in this business, but think big. You can start as a retailer of single mitumba items, grow to a wholesalers of bales and eventually an importer of a container or containers full of mitumba bales.\n",

    "With the right knowledge, proper pricing and marketing that we shall teach you in our Mitumba Business Training, the sky is the limit.\n",

    "15/06/2022, 9:32 am - +254 754 839228: *HOW TO BECOME A REAL ESTATE AGENT IN KENYA*\n",
    "\n",
    "Becoming a real estate agent or a realtor is a great career choice – part time or full time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you love houses and properties you can consider getting into the real estate as a real estate agent. As a real estate agent/ realtor, you will assist your clients to buy, sell, or rent any type of property.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, before you go on, you don’t have to go to a college/ university to become a Real Estate Agent/ realtor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can become a real estate agent or realtor at any point in your life if you want to. But, you can’t just wake up one day and become one as you have to get licensed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although, there is a difference between a real estate agent and a realtor, they both do very similar roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a real estate agent, you are basically allowed by the government through the license to assist the public to buy, sell, or rent a property.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be realtor, you first acquire the license from the government as a real estate agent and then join a realtor association in your region. Therefore, the major difference between a real estate agent and a realtor is the association.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are in a realtor association, you are under an umbrella that covers other stakeholders in real estate. They include brokers, salespeople, property managers, etc. around the country. Every individual under the association is ruled and operates under a strict code of conduct/ ethics.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, to operate as a real estate agent or a realtor in whatever country you are in, you are required to be licensed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people associate the buying and selling of land with crooked deals because of the scandals around it, but trading in land can be good business if you understand the legal processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, many people now call themselves commission agents for land. The business offers good commissions if you successfully conclude a transaction. For example, 10 per cent commission from a land sale worth Sh.1 million could earn you Sh.100,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You must know all the land transaction processes if you are to succeed in this business,” says Pius Katambo, a land agent at the Coast.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Land transactions are not difficult when all the required documents are available,” says Katambo, who has more than 20 years of experience in the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get into business as a land agent, all one needs is an office and the usual business licenses from your county government.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where land ownership documents are missing, there are procedures for getting new documents from relevant government offices. Part of the duties of a land agent is to help clients by following up on the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real estate is a rewarding career but many new agents don’t survive the first year. There are many reasons for this failure rate but number 1 is lack of patience. And the attitude to make money quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success loves those who know what they want and how they will get it. Don’t rush into making money. Sit and draw a road map. \n",
    "\n",
    "What do you want to achieve? How are you going to reach your target?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Niche down – You cannot be a Jack of all trades in real estate*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many niches in real estate. This means that you have to choose a niche. Once you have chosen your niche work to become an expert in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Become so good that clients will start talking about you for a particular service. There are 4 broad real estate niches;\n",
    "\n",
    "• Location niches\n",
    "• Seller niches\n",
    "• Consumer niches\n",

    "\n",
    "*Hunt for new clients relentlessly*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day make sure to add a new prospect into your business. Clients are everything to a real estate agent. The more you prospect the better you become in finding new customers.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is a good idea to join as many relevant networks as you can. This way you are able to generate a steady flow of potential clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Customer service is crucial because the client is the King*\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep all communication channels open to your current and potential clients. High degrees of communication make customer retention at above-average levels.\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember – communication is key to business success.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is the income of a real estate agent?*\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on the agreement between the agent and the property seller. Most are paid on commission. The agent sells a property and he or she earns a commission.\n",
    "\n",
    "The commission percentage ranges from 5 to 20%. This is determined by the nature of the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A piece of land is sold for 10 million. As the agent, your commission is 10%. How much is your pay in that transaction? 10% of 10 million is equal to 1 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Take real estate agent courses to improve your skillset*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need skills to excel in whatever you choose to do in life. Therefore before you begin your real estate marketing journey get trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "And after the initial training don’t stop learning. Continue taking courses to improve your knowledge and skill set. At the onset, you need at least a certificate to prove your seriousness to clients. Let people know you are trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the small courses you can do to become a successful real estate agent?\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You take your time to learn from mentors, the industry, and peers. Those who took the time to learn and gained experience are millionaires today.\n",

    "There is never a fixed amount of revenue that you’re expected to get.\n",
    " \n",
    "With mitumba business, you can make a profit of more than 50% of the buying price with a suitable location with many customers like near colleges or in market centers. The startup cost is low and you can start with little capital and grow your business over time. \n",
    " \n",
    "Its expenses are less since you only need to pay for licenses and permits. You can opt to sell from a store, open market centers or online.\n",
    " \n",
    "My friend Alex is one of a kind. When I met him, almost five years ago, I was by then living in Thika. If you have been in Thika or any other town for that matter, you know how busy the streets are especially in the evenings, lined up with hawkers merchandizing all kinds of goodies.\n",
    " \n",
    "Alex was one of them and at that time he used to sell secondhand hand clothes commonly known as mitumba. He would wake up very early in the morning to go to Gikomba to buy stock.\n",
    " \n",
    "He no longer sells mitumba but he is the proud owner of two majorly stocked electronics shops in Nairobi and Kikuyu.\n",

    "He now imports his things from other countries and even has links with the likes of Sayona and Samsung where he gets his stock from.\n",

    "If you don’t have a lot of capital to start a business, I strongly believe that a mitumba business is one of the most profitable businesses you can venture into.\n",
    " \n",
    "Running a successful mitumba retail business requires you to be flexible. Adapt to seasonal changes and be willing to adjust your prices now and then. The items you will get will never be the same and you will need strategies on how to make enough from them.\n",

    "\n",
    "They say you really don’t know how good something is until you lose it. But as it turns out, more often than not, we take too many things for granted. May be you are sitting there hating your job, boss, family or even the government…but beyond all the negativity, there is always something positive you can choose to focus on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem however, is that the human mind is wired for drama and negativity. That is why negative news travels faster than positive news. My goal is to help you engage in a mind-shift; and just before you start whining about how unfair life is, always take time to appreciate these 8 things.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(1) Being Alive And Healthy*\n",
    "\n",
    "You woke up today. You can hear, feel, touch and taste. You can walk on your two legs which leaves you with lots of energy to wield a wide array of tools. Your hands are working just as fine and that’s why you can use your fingers to scroll through this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people have suffered from broken limbs, and they know just how it feels to lose those fine motor skills. Be grateful that you are still alive and that even if things don’t work out well, you can always go out there and push a hand-cart for a living.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(2) Being Young And Having Lots Of Time*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make money, buy cars, start mega businesses, but the time you are allotted by your maker can never be purchased or replaced. By virtue of being youthful, you still have lots of time to invest, fail, invest again and fail again. Your immunity is still strong which means you don’t need regular medication to survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can take big risks without worrying about exhausting your retirement package. Even if you lose your job today, you’re still young and can always start afresh someday. Even if you lose your business today, you still have several decades ahead of you to rebound. So stop wasting your time complaining. It is the most precious resource you have as of yet. Make good use of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(3) Freedom Of Speech*\n",
    "\n",
    "The freedom to express your opinion is another crucial thing we take for granted. You can blog condemning the Government’s incompetence and no one will arrest you. You can comment on the President’s timeline and still walk free. You can speak your mind to a blue-chip CEO through a simple tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other parts of the world, expressing your opinion can lead to serious repercussions. Just cross the border to Ethiopia and try poke holes on the track record of their government—you will be lucky to walk out scot free. So don’t take this freedom for granted. There are people in other parts of the world wishing they could get just a fraction of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(4) Free Air To Breathe*\n",
    "\n",
    "Early this year, Kenya was ranked among the “least toxic” country in the world. Compare that with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which were ranked as the most toxic countries. You are lucky to live in a country with clean air. Even when things go down south, you can always take a deep breath and start all over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(5) Access To Many Wonderful Opportunities*\n",
    "\n",
    "Gone are the days people used to complain about lack of access to information and capital. Nowadays, business blogs are here to offer you the latest dose of business practices, free of charge. Organizations like KCB and Safaricom are there to provide you with mobile loans just in case you are running out of funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily send and receive money using your mobile device. Anybody who entered into the world of business in the 90s will tell you just how easy things have become. There were times when sending money used to take weeks if not months. Don’t take this access to opportunities for granted.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(6) Your Parents Took You To School*\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not have become a doctor or a pilot as you wished when you were young. But it’s worth appreciating the fact that your parents or guardians took you to school. You may not have gone all the way to university, but at least you learned how to communicate in English – and that is why you can read this article like a boss.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can count your money, understand what comprises of a balanced diet and above all you can read and write. In short, you have all the skills it takes to succeed…it’s only that you are yet to begin appreciating yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(7) You Can Access Modern Technology*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are an avid follower of technology news, chances are that you’ve heard Kenya has the faster internet than USA. At 13.7 megabits per second, our country’s average data connection speed is almost twice as fast as the global average. You should therefore be proud that you can scroll through this article using as little as Ksh.10 worth of internet bundles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be proud that you can create your products and market them freely on Facebook groups, Instagram, WhatsApp groups e.t.c. Access to modern technology gives you immense advantage that you should never underestimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(8) Peace*\n",
    "\n",
    "Peace is one of those things you’ll never know they really matter until you lose them. I was a stranger to this fact until I was caught up in the 2007/2008 post-election violence in the Rift Valley. Basic necessities like mobile airtime, food, water, sleep and warmth of a house became a luxury. Even the sick could not be transported to hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Road transport was no longer available. Businesses that had taken decades to build went up in flames. The good thing is that we managed to come out of that hell-hole as a country. But the lesson I would like you to take-home is that the effects of conflict are far-reaching. Let’s value peace and uphold it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to challenge you to look around you for a moment. There are many things you have that others are not as fortunate to have. You have got quite a number of reasons to smile and keep going. It takes gratitude to unlock the fullness of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, don't forget to join our training on Mitumba Business.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a WhatsApp group called *MITUMBA BUSINESS TRAINING* \n",
    "\n",
    "In this group we are going to train and teach you for 22 days on how you can start, grow and profit from Mitumba Business in Kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitumba is a Kenyan name for second-hand items, clothes, handbags, school bags, and shoes. A mitumba business is one of the most lucrative businesses you can start with little capital. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sale of mitumba has changed many people’s lives, especially the youth who fail to secure formal employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle-class Kenyans refer to second-hand products as “okoa jahazi” since they are quite affordable and budget-friendly. All you need to do is play your cards right.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most people shy away from venturing into mitumba business thinking it is saturated. The truth is, it is so much profitable. Even with just Ksh.1,000, you can start a small-scale mitumba business and at the end of the day, you will get at least Ksh.500 profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is much better than staying at home doing nothing or waiting for someone to notice your application letter on their desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am not going back to formal employment,” Grace Adek says. She has been selling second-hand women’s clothes since she was a university student. \n",
    "\n",
    "“I would buy 30 extra dresses to sell to my schoolmates every time I went shopping for myself,” she says. “I would buy the dresses for Sh.50 to Sh.200, then sell them for Sh.300 to Sh.600 bob.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Four years ago she quit her job as a pharmaceuticals marketer to pursue her mitumba business fulltime. At the time, Grace had been dabbling in the business part-time while she worked her day job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you can start small in this business, but think big. You can start as a retailer of single mitumba items, grow to a wholesalers of bales and eventually an importer of a container or containers full of mitumba bales.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the right knowledge, proper pricing and marketing that we shall teach you in our Mitumba Business Training, the sky is the limit.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will be surprised to hear how this little wonder seed is causing ripples across the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because the seed has many health benefits ranging from omega oil to protein supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chia seeds came into the Kenyan market sometime before 2017 but it’s in early that year that the crop hit the market strongly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, its market has been expanding from the high end shops to retail supermarkets as information about the benefits of these seeds trickles down to a wider population. \n",
    "\n",
    "This made it to rise into the group of most profitable cash crops to grow in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tiny black and grey chia seeds provide a whole meal packed with proteins, Omega 3 fats and a dozen of other nutrients that include calcium, manganese, and phosphorus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chia seeds farming is being done commercially not only in Kenya. In fact, the crop is grown commercially in the US, Bolivia, Argentina, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Australia and Mexico for its seeds because of its high nutritional value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Growers in the Ord Valley, Australia, started trailing the crop back in 2005, following research by a Nuffield scholar who was looking for natural solutions to modern diet related diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This little crop with tiny seeds is causing waves not only in Kenya but across the world. This is because of its established and documented benefits. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chia Seeds have Omega-3 fats – it is the richest plant source of omega 3. These are essential fatty acids known for their effectiveness at lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, preventing heart disease among other health benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chia seeds are rich in fibre: Two tablespoons of Chia – about 25 grams – provide about seven grams of fibre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chia seeds are rich in minerals which include calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, manganese, copper, niacin, and zinc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chia seeds have a nutty flavour, and are a healthful addition to the diet sprinkled on cereals, yogurt or salads. You can also eat them whole or mix them into flour when baking bread, muffins or other baked goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chia leaves are also used to make therapeutic tea.\n",
    "\n",
    "These benefits are recognized worldwide giving this crop and its products a great demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chia seeds farming is relatively new in Kenya with the only documented farmers being found in Nakuru, Meru, Nyanyuki and lately Busia County where farmers with an aggregate 150 acres are growing the crop for export to Denmark with the support of the county government.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chia seeds farming in Kenya is easy and is not capital intensive as other cash crop ventures. The capital requirements are similar to other crop and could actually be lower considering that the crop is a pest repellent and can be grown without the need for spraying pesticides or applying chemical fertilizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the costs of chia seeds farming in Kenya for one acre is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Land lease – Ksh.5,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Ploughing – Ksh.3,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Harrowing – Ksh.2,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Planting – Ksh.3,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeds – Ksh.8,000 (Ksh.1,000 per Kg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Harvesting – Ksh.5,000\n",
    "           \n",
    "Total – Ksh.26,000\n",
    "\n",
    "The average yield per acre is 300 Kgs. Should the prices plummet from the Ksh.2,000 we are currently seeing on retail shelves of our supermarkets to a low of Ksh.500 per kg, a farmer will still make Ksh.150,000 in just 3 months from planting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, major clients in Kenya include people dealing with dietary conditions such as diabetics, people with high blood pressure and parents of young children that require omega3 fatty acids. Upcoming farmers also provide a huge market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chia is easy to grow, beautiful to look at, and offers lots of nutritional value. It deserves a place in every garden. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "With a fast growing market, you can take advantage of this opportunity to start a small farm. It grows in moderately warm areas with well-drained soil e.g. places like Nakuru, Uasin Gishu and Western Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "Best of all, the crop thrives organically and you need no fertilizer or pesticide to sustain it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea is still a soft target that you can take on. Remember, nothing good comes on a silver platter. Start small and dream big.\n",
    "\n",

    "The cost will depend on the type of toys you want to import and their weight but roughly a bale of let’s say 50kg will be around Ksh.350 per kg or a total of Ksh.17,500 per bale. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rates are however subject to change due to exchange rates and cost of shipping or air freight.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How can I import from UK when I am here in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t have to make a trip all the way to the UK. You only need to link up with foreign suppliers through online portals like gumtree.com where you can place an order. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you place an order you then contract a logistics firm to help you with shipment, custom clearance and delivery to your preferred destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Which duty or taxes apply to sending those toys from UK to Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for your imported goods to be allowed into the country (Kenya) you will be required to pay 16% of the total value of goods as Value Added Tax (VAT) in addition to 25% excise duty. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is to say if you import a 50Kg bale of used toys at the prices indicated above then you can expect to pay Ksh.4,400 Excise duty and Ksh.2,800 VAT. \n",
    "\n",
    "This payment will of course be made on your behalf by the logistics firm of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If I import some toys from the UK how long will it take for me to receive them in Nairobi?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The duration of time taken will depend on the mode of transport that you opt for. For instance, if you opt for air transport (which is a bit expensive) then you can receive your items in 1 to 3 days. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you opt for shipping (a bit cheaper) then you will have to wait for 21 days from the first day of shipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What other items can one import from the UK to start a small business with here in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import second hand (mitumba) clothes, used bikes, baby pushchairs, electrical appliances, used gym equipment and motor vehicle spare parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, these are sold at cheap prices in the UK and you can mark up the price and still make some good returns back home.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tips for Importing from the UK*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to purchase an item from the UK you first need to shop around and create connections with merchants. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this through your friends in Europe or through online classifieds sites like Gum Tree (https://www.gumtree.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "The option of online shopping is more practical and cost effective but it comes with a fair share of risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have identified the items that you want to ship, you will then place an order. Payment can be done through bank-wire transfer, mobile money transfer or Paypal according to the seller’s terms and conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, you can contact a UK-to-Kenya logistics firm which will help you by collecting the goods from the merchants, paying taxes and delivering to Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "For purposes of this article we consulted James Kamau of Kankam Exporters Limited a leading logistics firm with offices in Nairobi and the UK.\n",

    "\n",
    "“Sweet melons are giving me sweet returns. One fruit weighing around two kilos retails at an average of Sh.130, and in a month I can sell up to five tonnes of the fruit,” says Mr Steven Ithau.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Ithau, the proprietor behind Ithau Farm along Nairobi’s Ngong Road, started off as a watermelon and mango farmer and only started growing sweet melon following his customers’ demand for the fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sweet melons have gained quite a following as more people become aware of their health benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fruit has cancer-preventive elements, reduces oxidative stress and kidney cell damage, which is particularly helpful for diabetes patients, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and is rich in potassium, a nutrient that helps control blood pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Benefits*\n",
    "\n",
    "Sweet melons, despite their name, have lower fruit sugar (fructose) than most other fruits, making them kinder to your waistline. Their collagen content also helps keep your skin radiant and firm, and helps in healing wounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For customers purchasing sweet melons wholesale, Ithau’s prices range from Sh.80 to Sh.100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before he started farming the fruit, he says he visited a company in Nairobi offering crop nutrition services to have his soil sampled to determine if it was suitable for sweet melon farming and get insights on the use of fertilisers.\n",
    "\n",
    "“To ensure proper growth of the sweet melon plant, you have to provide the plant with organic fertilisers, which can be achieved by using cow manure or chicken waste,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ithau’s main sweet melon customers reside in the leafy suburbs of Lavington, Kileleshwa and Kitisuru, and business is good, he says.\n",
    "Unlike the more common watermelons, sweet melons are light brown or yellow on the outside, have a faintly sweet smell and their flesh is soft and green.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Maina Kigutha, a grocer at Ngara Market just outside the Nairobi Business District, says that the fruit has high demand but is in low supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I sell all my sweet melons by the end of the day, with each going for Sh.200. The Asian community located in Parklands and Ngara areas are my biggest clients. In a day, I sell up to 50 fruits,’ he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr Kigutha has also started slicing sweet melons and selling them in smaller pieces at lower prices to appeal to more customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I sell a slice at Sh.30 to Sh.40. This has increased the customer base for the fruit and boosted my sales.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This is more than the Sh.10 he charges for watermelon, and explains the price difference by saying that since sweet melon uptake is still relatively low, most people think the fruit is exotic and are willing to pay more for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you go about growing sweet melons?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Planting and care*\n",
    "\n",
    "The fruit requires rich soil. The melon vine also requires plenty of sunlight and heat for at least two to three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dig two-square-foot holes and put in four to six inches of manure or rich compost, add the sweet melon seeds and cover with soil.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Purchasing the seeds is quite expensive. I purchased 500 grammes of sweet melons seeds for about Sh.14,000, which is part of the reason the fruits fetch such a high price,” Ithau says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space each hole about 36 to 42 inches apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sweet melons require at least one inch of water a week as they grow, so keep the soil moist, but not waterlogged.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may stop watering them a week before you harvest as too much water in the final stages can reduce the fruits’ sweetness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, avoid walking between melon vines lest you destroy the leaves, which provide the sugars that sweeten the fruit. The more leaves on the vine, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if too many melons ripen on the same vine at the same time, their sweetness will be compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I prefer pruning some younger fruits to ensure that my melons have maximum sugar concentration,” says Ithau.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Harvesting*\n",
    "\n",
    "And how does he tell if his fruits are ready for harvest?\n",
    "\n",
    "“When a sweet melon ripens, it changes colour from gray to green to yellow. It also separates easily from the vine. Since the melon stops ripening when it is picked, you have to be careful you do not pick it too soon.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have picked the ripe melons, keep them refrigerated until they are ready for consumption. They can keep for up to two weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Make sure you do not wash them until they are ready for consumption to prevent them rotting or getting mildew,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ithau adds that insecticides and fungicides will be required to protect the crop from pests like cutworms and fungal diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "The ball is in your court. This idea is still a soft target that you can take on provided you are willing to put a little more effort than everyone else. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, nothing good comes on a silver platter. So psyche yourself up and go for it. Start small and dream big.\n",

    "\n",
    "Creating a competition is a very good business idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "What type of competition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well... any competition!\n",
    "\n",
    "So why is this a business idea? How can this become a business?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, people just love to compete. It’s in our genes. We love it. We love to best one another. We love to be recognized as the first and best amongst equals.\n",
    "\n",
    "So dig into this natural tendency of man of always wanting to compete and create something out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it. Why do you think we have Olympics? Grand Slams? World Cups? Beauty Pageants? Champions League? Big Brother? Quiz and essay competitions? Even ordinary school exams? And so many others, etc…\n",
    "\n",
    "Healthy competitions are good for the participants or competitors because they make us want to always do more to show that we are the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "It gingers that competitive spirit in us and makes us feel good. \n",
    "\n",
    "It enlightens our minds and keeps it fresh and alert. \n",
    "\n",
    "What’s more? \n",
    "\n",
    "It can even enrich us in so many ways—both the contestants and the organizers—in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have nothing to lose because when you create your own competitions, people will always want to test your skills or their skills against one another, and show you the stuff they are really made of!\n",
    "\n",
    "To me, the best part of creating a competition is that you set the rules!\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, it’s just like playing God!\n",
    "\n",
    "Just imagine that! What could be more fun than that? Your participants are having fun and you are also having fun too. In fact, more fun than everyone else, most probably!\n",
    "\n",
    "So go ahead. Start thinking now. What type of competition can you create that you think others might be interested in?\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, a great way of doing this is by starting with myself. I will ask myself, what type of competition will I like to participate in? Or enjoy seeing others participating in?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not different from how Austin Kleon put it in his book _Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative_ where he advised that as a creative person, you should write the type of book you would like to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be so surprised the ideas you might be able to come up with.\n",

    "In fact, you don’t even need to think too much or too hard. You can simply get innovative and modify the already existing competitions.\n",

    "Again, like Austin Kleon advised in that same book, he stated that since no idea is original, you are completely free to steal or rather copy smartly from others because that's exactly how every creative person or artist gets his ideas - from copying from others!\n",
    "\n",
    "So start thinking of how you can create a new competition or better than the ones that are already existing. \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe I have already mentioned a few examples you can start working on ASAP...\n",
    "\n",
    "As for me, I have already worked out an angle on creating my own competition. In fact, so many of them!\n",
    "\n",
    "And one clearly comes to my mind now because it is the number one on my list.\n",
    "\n",
    "And guess what it is?\n",
    "\n",
    "Listen, this is supposed to be a secret between us, I am already designing and working out the modalities of my own brand of Beauty Pageant! Yes, I want to organize a Beauty Pageant and once I have enough funds, I'm kicking it off!\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots and lots of fantabulous prizes running into millions will be given out to the successful participants or contestants who are expected to enter the competition which is the first of its kind for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then subsequent competitions will no longer be free to enter. Competitors will be expected to pay to enter and they will pay because they would definitely hear about the wonderful competition and the great prizes that were given the first time—and they will just want to compete the next time!\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s how I plan to monetize my beauty pageant. Of course, there are also going to be other ways to monetize the competition and trust me, I will keep on exploring and looking at all angles. \n",
    "\n",
    "So you go now and think of your own competition. Get creative. Find an angle to your competition. Give it an interesting spin.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be surprised with your results.\n",

    "\n",
    "In our today’s world, there is something going on in our country (and in so many other countries around the world too) that is very chilling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Something is very wrong somewhere. And very scary too. It has something to do with undergraduates, majorly…\n",
    "\n",
    "What could this thing be? Any ideas anyone…?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, don’t look far. It is the fact that more and more undergraduates are finding it very difficult to get a job once they graduate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unemployment is the problem. A very big problem. It is very scary but it is the reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what could actually be the problem? Why is it that so many of our youths are unemployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Does it mean that our undergraduates are not skilled or qualified enough? \n",
    "\n",
    "Or does it mean that there are no jobs at all to satisfy the needs of millions of graduates who are dumped into the labor market year in year out? \n",
    "\n",
    "Or does it mean that our government has completely lost it and has ran out of ideas on what to do and the necessary or right steps to take to arrest this cumbersome and worrisome development?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thoughts like this have been bothering me for quite some time and it is the same thought that has spurred me into taking up my pen to write my inner thoughts down.\n",
    "\n",
    "I knew I had to do this because it was kind of shocking to me when I realized that a greater part of the problem lies with the individual himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to deny this as much as you want, try to blame the companies, employers, the government, as much as you want but the simple truth is that at the end of the day, the individual still has a very and major role towards pulling himself out of or putting himself into the swampy and murky sea of unemployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing I have noticed with most of our undergraduates is that, when it comes to issues concerning unemployment, we tend to have this belief that when we get to that bridge, we will cross it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But do we cross it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, not so many do. So many are left wandering aimlessly and hopelessly, swimming every day in the murky water of unemployment with no hope of ever swimming to safety in sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you ask me, I would say the problem can easily be traced to lack of preparation on the part of the student. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will agree with me that most battles can easily be won if the fighters are adequately prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you are an undergraduate reading this, I want you to consider these article as that preparation, a forewarning and take it as that wake-up call that is calling you to take action today.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to take a different route in writing today. Most times, it is usually my style to point out a problem and then try to proffer some suggestions or solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, I will not be doing that. I will simply be pointing out problems after problems. My plan is NOT to provide the solution. My plan is for you the student to provide the solution!\n",
    "\n",
    "I won’t tell you what to do. All I want is for you to start thinking of what to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "I know this might be a very difficult terrain for most of us but the truth is that you cannot underestimate the power of thinking and the greater things that could be achieved through serious and focused thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I want to make you think.\n",
    "\n",
    "Am sorry if you find the things I am going to say scary, but the truth is that if it is fear that is needed to ginger you into taking action, I am afraid, I won’t pull punches when doing that, because the truth is that something needs to be done at all costs to prevent that catastrophic calamity that awaits us…\n",
    "\n",
    "So without wasting any more of your time, let me kick off the game by presenting you with these questions which I want any undergraduate reading this to become acquainted with while pondering the truths cum the questions that are raised in his or her mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "So these are some of the questions I will like all undergraduates to start thinking about as from now on. Sleep over it. Discuss it with you peers. Discuss it amongst yourselves. Discuss it with your lecturers and parents. Try to see if you can come up with their rightful answers the way it will definitely suit you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. Now let’s start.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What am I learning in school?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have any idea what you are learning in school? In other words, why are you in school? Do you have any idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know that as funny or strange as this might sound, only a few students will find this question easy to answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is most likely because most of our undergraduates are just there with no idea of why they are in school or what they are doing in school but for us to tackle the monster of unemployment and tackle to a standstill, this must change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it. What are you being taught in the school? Of what relevancy is it to you concerning what you want to achieve with your life—while in, and after school?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What other skills do I have?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, let’s say you are amongst the lucky and privileged group who know why they are in school and what they are doing in school. Let’s say you know what you are learning in school.\n",
    "\n",
    "But have you ever wondered whether that is enough?\n",
    "\n",
    "Has it ever crossed your mind that you might actually need to acquire some more knowledge and skills to be more efficient in your chosen career? \n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have any special talents that can set you apart from others? \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, come to think of it now, have you ever asked yourself this question: what am I so passionate about?\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you thought about the possibility of changing career in the event of you experiencing some changing fortunes in our very unpredictable world?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have hobbies and passions that you might depend on or fall back on assuming things don’t go according to plans?\n",
    "\n",
    "What plans do you have in the event of such an occurrence? Or are you waiting until you graduate before you start thinking along this line?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What connections can I make while in school?*\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best things the school system can do for anyone is to help you meet people. But many students don’t make use of this opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "What type of company do you keep while in school? Who are your friends? Why are they your friends? What type of relationship do you have with him or her or them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know anybody in your class right now who you can team up with assuming you want to start your own business? Or even further your career?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is your social life like? Or are you the type of student who is solely concerned with his books and nothing else?\n",
    "\n",
    "Who do you know? Where do you get your information from? Do you know anyone who can give you the right information that will help link you towards becoming gainfully employed? Or are you waiting until you get to that bridge?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How many people you know are employed after graduation?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This very question forms the basis of the wake-up call I’m calling for. Oh yes, start thinking about it now? \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a head count, if you like. How many people do you know become employed or get that job after graduation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, how long did it take them to get there? Have you ever asked them what they did to get where they are today? Or do you simply believe it was just their luck?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a student, are you scared or seriously bothered by the fact that so many people you see around you are either unemployed or underemployed? Or are you simply satisfied with the notion that it’s not your portion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now tell me, what plans are you making towards making sure that it will never be your portion? Can you name up to five points in this your plan? Or is it safe to conclude that you don’t have any plan at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Where will I work?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Schooling has always got something to do with getting a job or working. In fact, the system we have always had is the system of go to school, get a good grade and get a good job.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the question now that you are in school is where will I work? Okay, let me put it this way, where would I like to work?\n",
    "\n",
    "What type of job will I like to do? What type of job am I well suited for? What skills and qualifications am I required to have to be deemed fit to take on that type of job?\n",
    "\n",
    "Funnily enough, most students don’t even think about this—and some who do don’t have any clear answer to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know your capabilities so I am not going to tell you what job is best fitted for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you the business type? Or are you the white-collar job type? Or can you do both? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ask yourself now, what opportunities are available to me right now even as a student? Is there a way I could start earning even while I’m still in school?\n",
    "\n",
    "Start thinking about it—now!\n",
    "\n",
    "*How do companies make money?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In our world today, money rules. Oh yes, it’s all about the money! \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your situation and your ideology in life, you may consider this as a good thing or as a bad thing but you can never rule out the fact that money is so necessary in our world today!\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not have seen it but the truth is that you are going to school so that you can make money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, okay, okay. Don’t mind me. That is too superficial. Who doesn’t know that you are going to school so that you can acquire knowledge?\n",
    "\n",
    "But let’s look at it again. Why do you acquire knowledge? Of course, you acquire knowledge so that you can use it to get a good job that will pay you some good money in the end!\n",
    "\n",
    "So you see, one way or the other, it is still money!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let me now ask you this question, most especially now that you have also identified the type of company or work or job you are best suited for with the talents, skills and knowledge you have: how does your chosen company make their money?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may consider this. Do you have any idea what this company you would like to work for or work with is all about? So how do these companies make their money?\n",
    "\n",
    "You shouldn’t be necessarily only concerned with earning. Ask yourself now, what types of services or products are they offering or selling?\n",
    "\n",
    "What exactly are they doing to earn that money? Can it be replicated—the thing they are doing to make that money? \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, can I do that same thing they are doing by myself without necessarily being an employee of that very company?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What value can I add?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple truth about money is that it is a measure of value. A wise man once said that if you can solve people’s problems, you can never be poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "And solving people’s people means nothing other than adding value to their life either by making their lives easier, happier, simpler, enjoyable, more fulfilling or by lessening their pains.\n",
    "\n",
    "So any serious undergraduate who is also consciously troubled by the current state of world events as it concerns unemployment should also take the time to be pondering on the value he can add.\n",
    "\n",
    "What problems can I solve for people—with what I already know? What or how can I make their lives easier with the skills and talents and other resources already available to me?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick a company you know you like. Now, what problems could they be having? And what are the possible challenges I will have to overcome in trying to solve those problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Get thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "You won’t be in an undergraduate forever. Soon you will graduate and start having serious responsibilities to take care of. \n",
    "\n",
    "Start thinking and finding solutions to the above questions as easily as now before it’s too late.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*_Success story of Grace Kerubo_*\n",
    "\n",
    "Success comes in a way that nobody understands. I am one of few Kenyans who are fortunate to have touched some millions, thanks to my mitumba business in Gikomba.\n",
    "\n",
    "I graduated with a diploma in business administration from Nairobi Institute of Business Studies. I remember it was in 2007 when I got my first job at one of the law firms in Nairobi, and my salary was Ksh.12,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "I worked at the law firm for 6 month, waking up at 5.am and arriving at the office at 8.am. It became a routine and very monotonous because I was subjected to sitting in a chair for 8 good hours, making no extra cash other than my meager salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "My mitumba business was born when a friend of mine enquired whether I wanted to buy one of her clothes from her stalls in Gikomba. I actually visited the area to pick for myself the best dress.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used to know my friend was working in town but didn’t exactly know she was a mitumba trader. After arriving at her stall, I found over 10 women selecting clothes, just like me. \n",
    "\n",
    "Minute after minute, my friend was collecting money from her customers, and within 2 hours, I counted Ksh.4,000. That was the time reality hit me like hard, that I am wasting time in the office.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn’t tell my friend what I was thinking about; instead I picked my favorite dress, gave her Ksh.250 and disappeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two weeks later, I again visited her to enquire about the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though she was a bit hesitant to open up about the profit, she told me the business had managed to buy her a plot and built her mother a house-that’s in a span of one year.\n",
    "\n",
    "I pleaded with her to guide me on the process of starting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, one thing I learnt from the conversation is that business people are selfish with information, unless they are sure you will make use of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "One question she asked “are you sure you want to quit employment”. I swore by the name of God I was ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "She told me a small mitumba business in Gikomba requires Ksh.15,000 to Ksh.35,000 while a stall can consume Ksh.150,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "At that time I was having Ksh.70,000 in in my account. I decided to look for a stall at the market with the help of my friend. But it took me three weeks to get one.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I noticed was that she didn’t want me to have it near her stall. She even told me.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following week I had a stall fully stocked, with the help of Irene (my friend).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike many businesses, here in Gikomba, customers are plenty and as long as you have a good stock, profits are guaranteed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first sale I made earned me Ksh.50 as profit. The first day saw me selling 5 clothes, something that made me lose sleep due to excitement. Those five clothes generated Ksh.350.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second day I sold 9 clothes and later that week I went for a stock alone so that I could get acquainted to the supplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within 3 weeks, I was used to the business. But what I realized was that in business every coin counted. I learnt that lesson when I took lunch of Ksh.500 one day and made a loss of Ksh.200.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within one month I had Ksh.18,000 as profit. I used the money to increase my stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second month after increasing the stock and getting some regular customers, I made Ksh.33,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "This was the time I realized that in business it doesn’t matter how big or small it is as long as you dedicate all your time to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After 3 months, my former employer thought it was wise to call me to resume duty after I left without a resignation letter. But I told him off with a big NO. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this time I had grown enough horns to refuse any job offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "One year elapsed and it was time to take stock. And from the sales I made that year, I counted Ksh.300,000 in my account and a stock of Ksh.200,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is now 7 years since I started the business, and I can confidently say my account has over Ksh.15 million and still counting. I have a stock of over Ksh.1.3 million and I have managed to buy land in Nakuru.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I have learned from this business is that Mitumba business has good and bad times. During end month, I sell most of my stock but during the second week of every month, the flow of customers is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have also learnt that in business if you don’t closely monitor every sale, your business will collapse. You either employ a very trustworthy person or you run it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, education is useless if you can’t use it to create wealth. I learnt that, all along I used to cheat myself with small salaries while opportunities were plenty. Many degree holders have huge potential, but since they believe money is in offices, they end up leaving opportunities pass them.\n",

    "\n",
    "Many people don’t like to hear the truth about themselves… especially if this truth showcases weaknesses, shortcomings and downfalls. \n",
    "\n",
    "We all like to hear words like “you are your own boss,” “you are in control of things,” “you are one step closer to personal freedom”.\n",
    "\n",
    "But while being a businessperson comes with many perks, it turns out that sometimes our very own behaviors can end up being a liability to the very businesses we are trying to build. \n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is that your personal habits could actually be the ones causing your business not to grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are 5 notorious personal habits that are quite common in Africa; and ones that could actually be taking a toll from your many years of hard work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Mixing Business With Friendship*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are the kind of person who struggles to maintain boundaries between family, friends and business, then you are likely to have a difficult time managing your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, I am sure you have heard of the old quote that goes “Mix women with business and you will see dust”.\n",
    "\n",
    "While that quote may sound sexist, it actually passes a very important message. If every time you secure a government tender you rush to get a second wife or the so-called “side dish”, then chances are that you will not go far as a businessman.\n",
    "\n",
    "It all boils down to self-discipline and the ability to draw the line between the good and the bad. Just because personal freedom is a perk that comes with entrepreneurship, it doesn’t mean you have the right to over-indulge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moderation is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Withdrawing Capital From Your Business To Fund Your Expensive Lifestyle*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people get into business thinking that it will solve all their personal finance problems. They get into it in order to sustain a lifestyle their white-collar or blue-collar job could not cater for.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is nothing wrong with having a strong, monetary motive for getting into business, withdrawing money recklessly from your business account just because your girlfriend has been pushing you to take her to Dubai for shopping is a big no-no.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with being in business is that no one will limit you or dictate how you handle cash. But if you want to make meaningful progress then it is imperative to limit your access to cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to go about it is by regarding yourself as an employee of your company/business, whereby you earn a regular salary. It may sound like a retrogressive approach but it can actually help you stabilize your cash-flow especially at the early stages of growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. You And Your Bad Manners*\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not here to lecture you on how you should behave, but if your character is the only thing standing between you and your success then we have to talk about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "How refined are your manners? Are you the kind of boss who always scolds your employees in the presence of customers? \n",
    "\n",
    "Are you the type that always runs away with suppliers’ money? Are you the type that writes bouncing cheques and then switches off the phone?\n",
    "\n",
    "Or may be you are the kind that cannot work without smoking cigarettes or drinking one for the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how ratchet your personal life is, don’t let that become a burden to your business. Consider hiring an image consultant. Better still, invest in structures, whereby you can have someone else handle delicate things like customer care, accounts and debt collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Not Being Trusting Enough*\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost everyone makes this mistake in one way or another. We sometimes get too possessive of our business to an extent that we run everything from our handbags or briefcases. \n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t want anybody else to handle the cash because you think they are going to misappropriate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t want anybody else to make key decisions in your business/company because you want to feel like you are in control of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therein lies the problem with most African businesses. That’s why we don’t have many businesses that have been handed down across generations for decades. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the founder dies, he goes with all his ideas and the company/business collapses. Isn’t that what happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to realize that the business is bigger than your ego and insecurities. The world’s best companies of our time are the ones which the founder invests in other people and let’s them play a role in in the business/company/organization's growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Thinking Loans Are BAD*\n",
    "\n",
    "We all grew up listening to horror stories about loans. How Mr. So and So took a loan to start a dairy farm only for his business to be auctioned and left bankrupt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or How Mrs. So and So developed high blood pressure due to the frequent sighting of debt collectors near her village shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality though, loans are not all that bad. You only need to take them for the right reason and with the right motive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes a bit of loan financing is all it takes to overcome those primary cash-flow challenges that cause 80 percent of start-ups to fold up in less than two years.\n",

    "\n",
    "Are you aware that the construction sector is the fastest growing industry in Kenya currently? \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the recently released data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, construction industry grew at 13.6% faster than the financial and agriculture sectors which grew at 8.7% and 5.6% respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need rocket science to know where the big money is. Going by the recent trends, an investment in this massive industry would certainly be timely as well as rewarding especially due to factors such as devolution, discovery of oil and a growing middle class.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sorry for boring you with heavy jargon and numbers, I was just trying to help you see the opportunities that exist around you and what the future holds. Talking about opportunities, one incredible business idea from the construction industry is scaffolding rentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "My research has shown that Kenya has a serious shortage of scaffolds. Not many people have realized that it is possible to set up a small scaffolding rentals business with a small amount of capital. In my opinion, this is a ripe opportunity that is still under-exploited.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What Is Scaffolding Rentals Business All About*\n",
    "\n",
    "A scaffold is a temporary structure on the outside of a building that is being constructed. This structure can be used by workers to climb as they perform specialized tasks such as paint-work, building repairs or construction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another job of a scaffold is to hold concrete together in order to allow for formation of slab and pillars of a house under construction. Most constructors prefer to rent scaffolds as opposed to buying them as a way to save on cost and minimize liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Getting Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are planning to start on a small budget then its far much easier to start with wooden trappers and then you can advance to steel scaffolds as your business expands. \n",
    "\n",
    "So step one will be to find good quality pine/eucalyptus wood from the local timber yards. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kitengela would be a good place to begin your search although you can always expand your search to other parts of the region in order to get cheaper prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Ask for high quality 8 by 1 or 9 by 1 wood. Also ask for props.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Look For A Yard*\n",
    "\n",
    "A yard is basically an empty plot of land where you can keep your wood and props as you await customers to come rent them. This doesn’t have to be anything fancy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just a central area from where you will be running your operations from. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have an idle piece of land near a growing town center then this could be a brilliant way to put it to good use. Alternatively you can lease one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Look for a minimum 20x30ft piece of land that is accessible by motorized transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Plan For Transport*\n",
    "\n",
    "Because scaffolds are heavy items, it is important to plan on how you are going to be picking and delivering them to your clients. If you have a pick-up truck or a small lorry then you will have a slight advantage. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you are just a small investor looking to start from scratch, then you will need to talk to transporters in your area and negotiate prices in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Typically it costs about Ksh.2,000 to hire a pickup truck for about 2 hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4: Print Brochures and Business Cards*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have everything catered for, you can boldly start approaching prospective customers and handing them your business cards and price list. Your customers will mostly be foremen, commercial and residential property developers and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Your price list should be based on the duration of rental period. For instance, a popular price tag on the Kenyan market is Ksh.100 for each wooden scaffold rented for 40 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Important Facts*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Consistent marketing and good service are important ingredients for reaching a wider market.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For short distance deliveries you can use a cart (mkokoteni) to deliver. A new mkokoteni will costs you Ksh.20,000 to acquire.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Consider charging delivery/pickup fees to boost your revenue. Alternatively, consider providing free transport to woo new customers if there is competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "*As you advance you can switch to steel scaffolds which have longer life than wooden ones. Each unit will cost you about Ksh.1,000 to acquire although the price varies depending on the international price of steel.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You can expect to lose about 10% of wooden scaffolds due to wear and tear during each rental period. Essentially that means you can re-use a load of wooden scaffolds for a maximum of 10 times before they get worn out completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Steel scaffolds can be re-used for a much longer time and they are preferred where unique building shapes are required (e.g. dome shaped buildings).\n",
    "\n",
    "*The average rental price for wooden scaffolds is Ksh.100, steel scaffolds Ksh.150 and props Ksh.25 so you can think out your pricing on that basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Apart from scaffolds other items that you can add to your rentals list include: bucket hoists, concrete mixers, shovels, vibrators, ladders and wheelbarrows.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Consider insuring your equipment to avoid unexpected loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Demand for scaffoldings rental is available throughout the country particularly due to the effects of devolution. Some prime areas include: Nairobi Metro region, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru and Meru.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The only mandatory license required is the county single business permit which will cost you about Ksh.10,000 per year at most.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum Estimates For Wooden Scaffolds\n",
    "\n",
    "200 Pieces of Eucalyptus Timber – Ksh.50,000 (Ksh.250 per piece)\n",
    "\n",
    "200 Pieces of Eucalyptus Props – Ksh.16,000 (Ksh.80 per piece)\n",
    "\n",
    "Transport To Your Yard – Ksh.10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Others (Marketing, Miscellaneous) – Ksh.24,000\n",
    "\n",
    "TOTAL BUDGET = Ksh.100,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make a decent Ksh.1 Million per year on a small yard.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing about this business is that you don’t have to be involved in its day to day running. That means you can continue doing what you do best even as you leave this business to run in the background (provided there’s good marketing involved). \n",
    "\n",
    "Best of all, there is room for growth. The construction sector is a multi-billion venture and the future looks bright. So don’t hesitate, if you feel this is the kind of business that would resonate with your needs and passion, go ahead and give it a try.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are looking for a business that is fairly passive (does not involve a lot of hard thinking), and allows you to keep doing your current hustle, but still provides you with a nice return on investment then starting a small laundry business could be your best bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a laundry (also known as a laundrette or laundromat) you wash clothes for your clients using water with the option of using a washing machine or manual labour.\n",

    "It’s not only households that are outsourcing their ‘boring’ work. Organizations like schools, offices, factories, shopping malls, hotels etc. are willing to pay for professional cleaning services too! And that’s where you come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article reveals why professional cleaning services is really taking off in Africa and how you too can start an interesting business in this industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "My idea is that as an entrepreneur who simply wants to start small, you should invest in a laundromat first and nurture it gradually until it grows into a fully-fledged dry cleaning outlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step One: Find A Good Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know rent prices in most major cities of Kenya (and Africa in general) are too far above what a small investor can comfortably afford. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is a small hack to this especially if you are starting a business that relies on daily exposure to survive.\n",
    "\n",
    "You simply need to rent a small office which will act like your pick-up and drop-off point and a larger work area which will be your back-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "*-A Small Reception Office*\n",
    "\n",
    "Find a small room in one of the busy streets and rent it (something like 5ft by 5ft). This room will mainly serve as your reception area – and this is where your customers will drop and pick their laundry.\n",
    "\n",
    "*-A Larger Work Area*\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for another less strategic area or backyard which you will be using as your work area. This is where all the work of cleaning, drying and ironing clothes will take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this simple formula (of having a small strategic front-end and a large less strategic back-end) will help you save on rent even as you maximize on exposure. You however don’t have to use this clever rule if you own the premises or if rent prices are not a cause of concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Two: Carpentry Work*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your front end will require a bit of a facelift. You will also need a closet for storing clothes both at your small office and at your work area. A good carpentry engagement will cost you about Ksh.30,000 to get the job done to the best possible standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Three: Get The Machine*\n",
    "\n",
    "For a small scale venture, an ordinary front loading machine will be good enough for the job. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such a brand new machine costs Ksh.50,000 and it can handle between 6Kgs and 7Kgs laundry load per wash cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will however need to replace it immediately more customers start coming in (say more than 15 customers per day) with a commercial laundry machine that costs about Ksh.200,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the washing machine you will need:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A Dryer – Ksh.22,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Iron Box – Ksh.4,500\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ironing Board – Ksh.5,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Folding Board – Ksh.5,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Detergents & Others – Ksh.20,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Where to find the machines: Most of these machines are available at your local supermarket. However, if you are looking for heavy commercial ones then you may want to import one or link up with suppliers like Benham International located on Mombasa Road in Nairobi.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Four: Get Licensed*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will generally require two licenses to start. That is the single business permit and the outdoor advertising license. Both licenses are issued by the county governments. On average you should set aside an extra Ksh.25,000 for these.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you play music publicly, you will be required to have an MCSK license. For those in Nairobi County, a fire clearance certificate may also be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Five: Market Yourself Widely*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to beat the competition you will need to differentiate yourself. For instance, if you have a small vehicle at home that you are not using, you can start offering door-to-door pickups and drop offs for your busy clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition you can capitalize on word-of-mouth, social media and poster marketing to get the word out. Remember, the quality of customer service you give can make or break your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "In total you will need Ksh.180,000 – Ksh.200,000 to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "A well run and marketed laundrette can make you Ksh.100,000 in net profit per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is more to starting a laundrette than just the money. The future of this business looks bright because Africa’s middle class population is growing at a steady rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, there is the possibility of growing this into a fully-fledged dry cleaning outlet whereby you can even partner with big hotels and institutions for bulk services.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why Is The Professional Cleaning Services Business Booming Across Africa?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Every business opportunity exists for a reason. In this section, we will look at the factors that are responsible for the growing demand for professional cleaning services in Africa. The information here will help you to better target potential customers and convince partners and investors of the viability of this business opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why is the professional cleaning business booming across Africa? Here are the reasons…\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. People will pay to outsource boring and time-consuming chores*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most working-class people who live very busy lives in the cities have little time and patience to do boring and time consuming work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fewer people nowadays want to do their laundry or wash their cars by themselves. They would rather pay somebody else to do these chores. People in the city are very happy to pay for these services so that they can use the time to rest, relax and do more valuable tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "At an urban migration rate of 3.5 percent over the last 20 years, over 800 million Africans will live in cities and urban areas by 2050. Up to 40 percent of this population will belong to the middle class, an economic group that can afford to pay for professional cleaning services for their homes, rather than do it themselves. That’s quite a huge market. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most people will require professional cleaning services about once a week or month, depending on the level of cleaning required; basic or thorough. This makes private homes and residential estates a prime target if you want to enter this business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Special Cleaning needs*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most times, people don’t just hire professional cleaning or janitorial services because they are lazy. Some situations require special and trained attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "One good example is the kind of cleaning that is required after a big party, festival or conference. It’s not the kind of mess a few ‘ordinary’ people can handle alone. You will need to hire a professional cleaning service if you want a good job of cleaning out all the mess.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other times when people and even companies need specialized professional cleaning services. If you are moving to a new house or just finished renovating one, it’s likely that you will need a professional cleaning service that will use specialized equipment to clean the floors, carpets, walls, ceilings, bathrooms and toilets.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the current boom in the construction of residential and office buildings across African cities, the demand for cleaning services is surely rising as more people and organizations move into new houses/offices and renovate old ones. As the construction crews leave, professional cleaning services move in!\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. More organizations now prefer to outsource their cleaning needs*\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not just people who are paying to get their cleaning chores done. Factories, offices, schools, banks, hospitals, hotels, restaurants and all kinds of private and government-run organizations are outsourcing their cleaning needs too.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why are they doing this? Why don’t they just hire cleaners as employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, outsourcing their cleaning needs to professional service companies is cheaper, easier to deal with and more flexible for these organizations. They only pay for cleaning services when they need it. That’s why many organizations now pay a monthly or annual fee to professional cleaning companies to satisfy all their cleaning needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning is an essential task for all organizations, because cleanliness and hygiene is always good for any business. But unfortunately, cleaning is not a ‘core’ task for them. For example, a business will prefer to focus on tasks that make money and would rather outsource its cleaning needs to another company to take care of.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. It’s more flexible and convenient for people and businesses*\n",
    "\n",
    "Like I already mentioned above, people and businesses prefer to pay for professional cleaning services because of the flexibility and convenience that it provides. After a busy day or week, nobody wants to spend hours cleaning the house when they could be resting, relaxing or doing other interesting stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "For businesses of all sizes and corporate organizations, professional cleaning services provide value in terms of cost savings, greater efficiency, professional service, flexibility and convenience. These are the main reasons why more businesses are willing to hire professional cleaning services to handle their cleaning needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7 Things You Should Know To Succeed In The Professional Cleaning Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you ready to build a remarkable business in the professional cleaning services industry? Are you hardworking, versatile and willing to provide valuable service to people and make a healthy profit? If you meet these criteria, then you are a good match for the cleaning business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will learn a few important basics about the professional cleaning business that should help you get started as soon as you are ready. Here we go…\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Before you start, choose your target customer*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically two main types of customers in the professional cleaning business: Consumer (Residential) and Commercial (Office buildings etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this classification important? Well, the type of clients you choose to serve will determine what type of equipment you will need, how much you will charge, and the nature of the cleaning services you will be expected to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a quick breakdown of the two main customer types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial clients, such as office buildings, hotels, hospitals, schools, airports etc., usually require nightly or weekend-only janitorial-style cleaning. Washing the floors, cleaning the bathrooms, emptying trash cans, cleaning kitchen areas, and washing doors and windows are typical tasks that are often included in this type of service. This type of work is steady and pays well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumer or Residential clients usually require ‘maid services’. This includes general cleaning and tasks that are specific to the clients’ needs. You may usually have to work while the client is at home, and when you build trust, you could be given the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing Residential cleaning services will mean having a diversity of clients, since most homes only need to be cleaned once a week or so. This type of work doesn’t often pay as well as Commercial clients but you could become successful by serving a lot of residential clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. You will need materials and equipment. You can buy some and lease others…*\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the services you are offering and the kind of clients you get, you will need to have a range of materials and equipment to help you do a very good job. Brooms, buckets, rags, stain removers, trash bags and safety gear (rubber gloves, aprons, coveralls and dust masks) are just a few of the basic and affordable materials you will need. Don’t forget, gloves and masks are a very important if you are going to be handling toxic cleaning chemicals.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of your business, you can rent equipment (like vacuum cleaners) so that you will have the chance to make sure it’s up to your standards before making a purchase. Make sure that you only invest in heavy-duty equipment that will be able to endure a lot of wear and tear and last for many years.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also ensure that your equipment are always clean and in good working condition at all times. It projects a professional image for your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Employees – Hire carefully!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Hire only qualified workers. The people who do the actual cleaning work (your employees) are the face of your business. Anything they do poorly or wrongly could potentially damage the reputation of your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why you should only hire hardworking, committed, honest and customer-friendly people. Apart from these qualities, they should always appear clean, neat, and wearing attractive uniforms. This helps to create a good image for your business. You should also do background checks on the people you hire to be sure they don’t have a criminal history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important thing you should know is that you can easily lose employees in this business. The employee turnover in the professional cleaning and janitorial services industry is high. So, to attract and keep the best and loyal employees, you will have to pay competitive wages and offer good perks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another good idea is to consider working with a hiring agency on a job-by-job basis if your projects will vary in size and length. This will prevent employees from being idle and quitting during slow times.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Marketing – How to find and keep customers.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The great thing about this business is that you can build a very successful cleaning business on referrals from satisfied customers. If you do a good cleaning job, your happy customers will gladly recommend and refer you to their friends, family, neighbors and colleagues. But you need those first customers to get started, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding your first few customers isn’t always easy but you can start with your friends and relatives, neigbours, former co-workers and employers, social groups and clubs, church or religious acquaintances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great marketing strategy is to design marketing materials (like fliers, brochures, business cards etc.) that clearly lay out your services and communicate the uniqueness of your business. Drop off fliers, door hangers and business cards to new businesses in your area as well as other businesses within your target market. Introduce yourself to managers of these businesses in person or by phone and ask if you can provide professional cleaning services.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Your reputation matters a lot in this business. Guard it!*\n",
    "\n",
    "As you begin working for clients, it’s very important to do your job well and respect your clients’ space. Any sign that personal property has been tampered with, damage has been caused and gone unreported, or something has been stolen, can ruin your reputation as a cleaning business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things you and your employees must always keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "If something gets broken while you are on the job, let your client know and either replace the item or reimburse your client right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put items back where you found them after cleaning them. Don’t touch people’s personal items unless you have been instructed to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stay out of rooms you haven’t been instructed to clean. You don’t want to be accused of something you didn’t do.\n",
    "\n",
    "You and your employees must always operate and behave in such a way that your clients, whether residential or commercial, will be comfortable trusting you and your employees with unsupervised access to their homes, offices and facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Office versus Vehicle: which is more important?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is, you can start a professional cleaning business from your home. It’s unlikely that your clients will visit your office, unless you are serving really large organizations that may want to confirm your existence. Otherwise, all you really need is a good space to safely store all your equipment and materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you may need a vehicle to function properly in the cleaning business. Because most of your work will be done at your client’s location, a vehicle is actually more important than an office space for your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "An economy car should be perfect for small jobs while a truck or van will be most suited for heavy-duty cleaning and janitorial services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever you choose, your vehicles should always be clean, running properly and neatly marked with your company name, logo, contact information (telephone number and email) and the services you provide. Don’t forget, a dirty, dented truck that belches smoke won’t impress your clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Pricing is important. Whatever you do, don’t lose money!*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you give your price for any cleaning jobs, you need to take into account the cost of labour, materials, and overhead. You need to consider all these costs so that you can figure out how much to charge for your services and make a profit. You are free to negotiate prices with each new client, but it’s good to have a baseline in mind so that you will be able to stay in business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, in many cleaning situations, you may be competing against the customer himself. If your price is high, he or she may think, “For that much money, I can just do this myself.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Do some research to find out how much other cleaning businesses charge for services like floor cleaning and janitorial services so that you can remain competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Ready To Get Started?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next few decades, professional cleaning services will remain one of the most interesting and lucrative business opportunities across Africa. In many parts of the continent, it’s still a new concept that will eventually spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need a lot of capital to start this business. It’s one of those businesses you can start from home before you grow and expand into a standalone business. With commitment, hardwork and a good reputation, you are very likely to succeed in this line of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "To your success!\n",

    "23/06/2022, 12:24 pm - +254 701 711058: *WHY NOT START TAMARILLO FARMING AND WATCH YOUR MONEY GROW ON TREES?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have been dreaming of eating the fruits of your own labour then the idea of farming tree tomatoes (aka tamarillo or matunda ya damu) is a literal way to do just that. \n",
    "\n",
    "The oval-shaped fruit is gradually taking over the market and supermarkets are scouting for farmers to help them meet growing demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "One good thing about this crop is that once you plant a few seedlings you do not have to care of them everyday which means you can set-up a farm somewhere maybe near your current place of work and monitor it remotely as a side hustle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most interesting bit of it is that you can get started with your meagre savings and make as much as Ksh.133,000 per month out of a small chunk of land. \n",
    "\n",
    "But before you rush to invest here are some steps you need to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Find Land*\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, in order to plant anything you need some land. But you don’t necessarily have to buy one. Nowadays, you can easily lease land from farmers across the nation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal piece of land is one that is fertile and well drained. Preferably located in a place with adequate supply of water and relatively calm winds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is to say you can plant your tree tomatoes in places like Central Kenya, Western, parts of Nyanza, Taita Taveta and even parts of Rift Valley. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fruits can even grow in semi-arid areas provided there is adequate water to irrigate them (in addition to mulching). \n",
    "\n",
    "Set aside Ksh.15,000 for leasing land if you do not have any available.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Prepare The Land*\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from tilling the land and preparing the holes you will need to buy a water tank. This will come in handy during dry seasons because tree tomatoes require adequate watering at least once a week. A good water tank with 1,000 litre capacity will cost you about Ksh.15,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Find Good Seedlings*\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all tree tomato seedlings are good. Some take too long to grow and their fruits are bitter and unsightly. \n",
    "\n",
    "So at this point you need to look for high quality seedlings that are grafted. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good breed is the red otaria family that only takes 8 months to mature. The reason the red otaria type is popular is because 97% of it is edible and it has no seeds inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "A seedling goes for Ksh.50 from HCDA and KARI recommended nurseries in the country. An acre of land will require 1,200 seedlings amounting to Ksh.60,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you can always start small e.g. on 1/8th acre which requires 300 seedlings and thus a smaller budget of Ksh.15,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4: Plant and Wait*\n",
    "\n",
    "Plant the seedlings, keep caring for the farm and wait for about 8 months. Normally, that is the time it takes to see the first fruits. And one more thing… remember to set aside a small budget for insecticides because aphids can sometimes be a bother.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the outskirts of Kapsabet town, I met John Kosgei.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kosgei is farming tree tomatoes, a crop many in this part of Kenya have never seen before, the reason residents of Chebarbar village would not stop talking about him.\n",
    "\n",
    "He is farming Tamarillo, a crop that resembles tomatoes and is also known as Tree Tomato.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I started growing Tamarillo out of curiosity. I credit it to my wife because had she not bought the fruits in the supermarket and came with them home in 2010, I would not have ended up farming them,” says Kosgei, whose wife is a head teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of curiosity, Kosgei dried the Tamarillo seeds, which he extracted from the juicy fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "He then planted the seeds in a nursery that he had been using to grow other crops. “I was excited when the over 20 seeds germinated. I transplanted them but only 11 trees survived. They did not do well thereafter.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Kosgei attended a workshop on horticultural farming in Kapsabet town later where he took keen interest in cultivation of the crop.\n",
    "\n",
    "He figured out where he had gone wrong. “I discovered that I had spaced them incorrectly besides failing to take care of them properly.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2011, armed with the knowledge he had received from the workshop, he destroyed the 11 plants and planted 110 seedlings spacing them at the conventional two by two metres space.\n",
    "\n",
    "He mulched them during the dry season and pruned them correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Transplanting is done when the seedlings are between 60 to 70 days old or when the seedling is 15 to 20cm long. Planting holes should be dug 30 to 45cm deep with a diameter of 60cm to accommodate sufficient volume of manure,” explains Kosgei.\n",
    "\n",
    "When his crops started to flower in September 2012, they attracted several residents who came to his farm to inquire about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It is a lucrative venture and since I am the only farmer in this region, the market is overwhelming. Customers even book them before they ripe. They come from as far as Eldoret,” says the farmer, who notes one of his biggest challenges is lack of enough water.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Kosgei, growing Tree Tomato is not labour intensive and requires little capital to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The crops take about a year to mature. One then picks fruits twice a week for the whole year except when you spray them to kill pests.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tree produces an average of 125kg of fruits annually. He, therefore, picks approximately 13.5 tonnes of fruits yearly and sells a kilo locally at Sh.30.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I get buyers from surrounding areas and beyond. Some come here, others I supply to them.”\n",
    "\n",
    "He says his production is steady except when the weather is cold.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Kapsabet, July is chilly while March is the driest month. “Compared to maize, which other farmers grow, the proceeds from Tree Tomato are better. Here, maize farmers get on 0.2 acre like mine Sh.15,000,” says Kosgei, who is a Horticultural Corporation Development Authority licensed operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other crops he grows include grafted avocados, bananas and passion fruits.\n",
    "\n",
    "He also grows flowers like daisies, roses, lilies, dew and landers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the most outstanding crops on his farm are the over 5,000 Tamarillo seedlings, which he sells at Sh.50 each.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Nursery operators are normally adventurous. We try out different plants especially unique ones. Many people thought the crop could not grow because not a single farmer had ever attempted planting it before in this area,” says Kosgei who has used proceeds from the farming venture to pay for his children’s school fees and his education at Gretsa University, Kapsabet, where he is undertaking Bachelor of Arts in Developmental Studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amos Ego, a plant breeder at University of Eldoret, says Tamarillo is a delicious egg-shaped fruit, whose origin is South America.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The plant looks strange because its skin is not eaten. The skin is tough and bitter but the flesh is sweet and juicy. The flesh holds soft black seeds nested in a red gel, which is sweet,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fruit has an upright trunk with lateral branches that bear pink-white fragrant flowers, shallow roots and yields long fruits with dark longitudinal stripes.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Because of such roots, the crop should be planted in deep holes to protect them from winds. They also require moderate well-distributed rainfall, temperature of between 15 to 20 degrees Celcius and a soil pH of five to 8.5.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Ego, however, says the crop is highly susceptible to bacterial wilt and should not be intercropped with crops such as potatoes and cabbages.\n",
    "\n",
    "He adds, “Organic manure used should be fully decomposed to ensure that it does not become a source of diseases and to ensure that maximum nutrients are obtained especially when farm yard manure is used.” In addition, the crop should be sheltered from direct winds to protect flowers and fruits from damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "He advises farmers to diversify their crops to meet the dynamic consumer preferences. However, he counsels that one should seek advice and information before investing in such enterprises.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Farmers should read as much information about their venture of interest as they can find. For tree tomato farming, you should find all the information starting from propagation to harvesting.” He says, and adds that farmers should also seek information from others who grow the crop.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A middle-aged man was jogging in a park when he noticed another man about half a kilometer ahead of him. The middle-aged man noticed that the jogger was running a little slower than him which made him feel good.\n",
    "\n",
    "He said to himself, “I will try and catch up with him.” He started running faster and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "He gained on him step by step and passed him. \n",
    "\n",
    "After a few minutes he was about 100 feet behind another runner, so he picked up speed and pushed himself further. He was determined to catch up with the other jogger. And finally, he did it! He caught up and passed him.\n",
    "\n",
    "The middle-aged man felt very good and said to himself “Yeah! I beat him too.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the other guy didn’t know that they were competing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then the middle aged man realized that he had been so focused on competing against the other runner that he had missed his turn to his house, had missed the focus on his inner peace, had missed to see the beauty of the greenery around, he had missed to do inner soul-searching meditation — which was why he was in the park in the first place — and in the needless hurry he had stumbled and might have hit the sidewalk and broken a limb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about this, isn’t that exactly what happens in life when we focus on competing with co-workers, neighbours, friends, and family trying to outdo them or to prove that we are more successful or more important and, in the bargain, we miss on our happiness?\n",
    "\n",
    "The story got me thinking about how common it has become for us to compare ourselves with others. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we need to learn is we are all unique in our own way. Our individual characters, life experiences and backgrounds shape us, so we need to stop using someone else as a marking scheme for success. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are capable of doing more than we do but we never realize our true potential because we are too busy competing with those around us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competing with someone creates feelings of resentment towards them especially if you are unable to beat them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, you end up making enemies out of the people you are resenting, even though they could have been great friends, or great business partners. \n",

    "3. Hang out with people who help you to level up: You grow to be like the five people you spend most of your time with, so surround yourself with only those who are going to lift you higher.\n",

    "\n",
    "We are always getting a lot of inquiries regarding baking at home business. \n",
    "\n",
    "We did a live Q&A (Question and Answer) session on zoom some time back on the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to go through those Q&As on Baking for Business with a focus on home bakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question: I have done my costing and purchase of ingredients is wholesale. However, I feel like maybe I’m not doing it right? (Pricing)*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer:* I tell bakers all the time that the first step is always costing your goods. I also encourage bakers to buy ingredients in bulk instead of buying at the supermarket or shop. Why? Because not buying ingredients in bulk (instead buying retail from shops) is part of the reason why your cakes are so expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to cost your cakes effectively and sell at a certain price, you need to figure out how to buy things in bulk. This way you even save costs on ingredients. However, you may do all of this and still struggle to make sales. Why is that?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be selling your products to the wrong people. To give you an example, if you have a premium product, say a 1kg cake that goes for Ksh.3,500. However, instead of selling it to premium clients who would pay that amount, you sell it clients on a budget, you would be working against yourself, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing when it comes to costing; you might not be including all other costs e.g. airtime, internet costs, Mpesa charges, bank charges, other transport charges for the business, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you are capturing ALL expenses that you pay for in your business, not just ingredients and packaging. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Question: How do you pick a niche?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer:* When it comes to picking a niche I’ll ask you just one question. What are you good at?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to venture into the wedding niche but you don’t really know how to make wedding cakes. So the big question would be, what are you good at, and more so, what need/gap have you identified in the market?\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to picking a niche, first look at the skill(s) you have. If you haven’t quite advanced your skills in making wedding or custom cakes, then it might NOT be a good idea to start taking wedding cake orders within your first month of business, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, take time to learn the skills involved in doing wedding cakes. Meanwhile, what you can do is, perhaps you are really good at doing cookies and pastries; do just that. Sell cookies and pastries to people looking for cookies and pastries. Or if you are able to do cupcakes and easy Whipped cream cake designs; you can start with that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify your products, whatever it is that you settle on. Figure out who wants those products and where they stay (or where their attention is). You might find that cookies and pastries do best in corporate settings like offices where they want something they can have as a snack really easily. Your target market would then be corporate working class people in offices or parents looking for snacks for their kids.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you find your target market and give them a product they actually need and that you know how to make, that’s how you identify a niche to sell in.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question: How to get noticed and known for people to try you out. It’s really tough for me and maybe for other beginners like me.*\n",
    "\n",
    " *Answer:* That is true. The one thing that we will never lie to you about is the fact that starting a business is easy, especially as a home baker. It never is.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of bakers in the market right now which means it is quite saturated. You have to prove to people that your baked product is worth buying. Otherwise, why should they move from their current baker and start buying from you?\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why I advice home bakers to get into business knowing that when you start, it’s not going to be easy. It’s going to be hard, which is why you need to have a marketing plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the process is always identifying your niche; for example, celebration cakes. These are cakes celebrating some occasion such as birthday cakes, baby shower cakes, etc. You can choose to specialize even more, perhaps your focus can be on Celebration cakes decorate with Soft frosting only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by showcasing your skills on soft cream cakes. It doesn’t matter even if you’re not getting orders. All you need to do is start practicing and taking very good photos with good lighting in a nice background and start posting those pictures on your social media pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to go onto Instagram and share your work in your stories. Then you need to go to social sites like Facebook, if you are in Facebook, and post in retail, foodie or baking groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the niche that you are in, you can start doing samples as you start looking for your target market, but be careful about samples. Tell people you have samples; for them to be aware that you sell cakes and let them know if they want them they have to order and pay. You can even give them a copy of your menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also give cake/pastries samples in exchange for reviews. The individual can share a review on Twitter. They can share a photo and tag you on Instagram and write what their feedback was of your product. They can even go on Facebook and leave a review on your page. Whatever the case, you need a good review and you need it to be public (social sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Doing this may give you your first customers. You can also identify potential clients who are your target market; give them samples, have them taste your products in exchange for feedback. We call this social proof. All that means is that the person is telling other people, “I have tasted his/her cake and guess what, it’s really really good.”\n",
    "\n",
    "So the first few months you want to give samples to your target market. Not everyone of course, just some few people, and all they have to do is taste your cakes and give good reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing about reviews is that it lets your clients know you’re not the only one who thinks your cakes are awesome, other people do too. That way if you have at least three to four reviews on your page, you are off to a great start.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do cake tasting. I know it’s a little difficult but if you can manage an estate cake tasting, that would be good for your business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social proof goes a long way in boosting your business. Depending on your resources, you can even look for foodies who do food reviews. Then you can just send over your product and they will review it online for you. It does wonders in letting people know about your products and draws them in towards eventually buying from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question: As a home Baker, can I bake and sell to friends and neighbors without the legal requirements of a bakery?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer:* This is a really common concern that I like tackling and talking about very honestly. First and foremost, the rule or law of Kenya and specifically the City Council which is the legal body that handles such matters is very clear on the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "For one, the city control law states that you should never do business from a residential property. So starting out, it is important to be aware of this. Number two, there is a rule that says you cannot sell manufactured products like food from a house or place that is adjacent to your sleeping area. In this case that constitutes your house.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, you may have noticed that a lot of people who are home bakers start by looking for a separate unit outside the house. Now of course you are going to start at home, and you can sell to your friends and neighbors. However as your business grows, it becomes a little harder to keep running the business from home.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the business grows exponentially, people start to pay attention to you and some will realize you are baking from the house. Not everybody’s very happy with that fact. To avoid this, as you start your business, set goals. Tell yourself something like, within 8 to 12 months, I’m going to switch my kitchen from home.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some options you could explore. You can opt to find a shop outside somewhere close by that you can rent. That way you can still bake from the house and take your goods to the shop. It can also be a pickup point or somewhere you display your cakes. The point is; it’s a step in the right direction as far as adhering to the law is concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "So yes, you can start selling to friends at first. You can even sell from your house, just know the rules and how far you can go. Fact is, as the business grows, you will have to find a more favorable location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing you could do is relocate the kitchen. If you live in your own home and own your own land, you can build a separate kitchen on the side. It would still be in the same compound, yes, but it would be strictly for the purpose of conducting your home bakery business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please do note though that according to law, the land you set up your separate kitchen on cannot be residential (Of course; there are exceptions of cottage industries – please visit your local county council offices for clarification please). It either has to be a commercial property or what we call a multipurpose property. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important thing though is to take the first step to come out of the house. It can even be to use a Servant’s Quarter (SQ) if available. That way it serves as your business’ legal premises in your 8 months to one year plan. If you are looking to get serious about your business, please look into that.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t have this option but have a big space in your house, then find a room that’s separate from the kitchen. Again we will repeat, as a home baker looking to grow your business commercially, you can never work and stay in the house, that’s illegal. KRA and the government have been quite vigilant on telling business owners to do things right. Please do things right so that it doesn’t develop into a legal issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question: Which is the best and safest cake preservative?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer:* It’s very ironic to call a cake preservative safe, after all, these are chemicals. Over time, in excess, they are not really good but in moderation they are fine. Our advice is to find goods sold by a certified food merchants. These include but are not limited to Pradip Enterprises LTD and Topserve Limited Kenya. They stock goods that are KEBS verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you go to a cake supply shop or a food additives vendor like Pradip Enterprises, they sell food-safe preservatives. You should never buy preservatives with no labeling on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why we advice that when it comes to preservatives, go to places like Pradip Enterprises. They manufacture the preservative themselves, they write the instructions on usage.\n",
    "\n",
    " Realize that there are different types of preservatives; there is one that is used for bread preservation i.e. Calcium Propionate, and there’s are also variations of cake preservatives e.g. Sorbex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most bakers in Kenya don’t particularly use preservatives. If you would like to know more about cake preservatives, kindly visit the manufacturer. They will be at the best position to tell you how to use them safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question: How is a business plan done depending on the area one is so that one can know how to sell?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer:* A business plan is very important. It’s a blueprint of your business and will answer a majority of the important questions e.g the name of your business, what niche you are in, what products you’re selling, how you’re going to cost them and who you’re going to sell them to.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also tells you how to structure your business. Let’s say you’re in business with someone else, maybe a spouse or a sister. You will need to write who the directors of the business are and what they do. Getting things very clear in terms of exactly what everyone’s role is in the business is a prerequisite of the business plan.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are the baker and the other individual is the delivery person, or if they are doing the business financial accounts, their job description needs to go into the plan. If you’re going to do business with someone else, make sure it’s included in your business plan. Note down all their tasks and this includes mentioning any contracted labor that you need e.g a baker or delivery person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also take note that business plans change. You might have to alter it every year. When you have one in place though, it makes alterations so much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question: Do you need any food safety or health certification to operate as a home baker?*\n",
    "\n",
    " *Answer:* Yes, you do. It’s called a Food Handler’s Certificate. What a Food Handler’s Certificate is supposed to do is prove to people and the government that it is safe for you to be handling food and selling it to your clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember once you choose to start doing business, you have a responsibility to prepare food safely for someone else to consume. If you had typhoid for instance, and prepared food without taking the necessary precautions and somebody eats the food, then you would infect your clients as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore your responsibility to ensure that you are healthy and taking safety measures to prepare healthy safe food to give to another person.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I would tell you as a home baker is to go online to ecitizen.go.ke, sign up and pay for your Food Handler’s Certificate. If you have never signed into ecitizen.go.ke, sign in now and sign up for an account. This is how you access, many things like a driver’s license and passport. It is also where you can pay for the Food Handler’s Certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question: Having a full time job and you want to start a home based bakery. How do you juggle?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer:* It’s tricky, I won’t lie. I have a friend who had to quit her job to start her baking business, but that was a personal choice. I do know people who have done both (being employed & run a baking business) but you need resources – which is a good thing when you are working. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are working, you need to identify early enough who is going to help you in your business. This means you can’t be the one who’s baking all the time. You can choose to be the one who’s baking in the evening and even that might be tricky because you’re going to be stretched too thin.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose to bake at certain times and deliver at certain times. I know of bakers who allow clients to order at any time, but only do deliveries on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore choose to have specific delivery days. This will help you collect all your orders, bake them at a certain time and deliver the cakes to your clients. It also helps you manage your time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing I always advocate for is having systems in place. This means training a baker to start assisting you. You can start by just having the assistant baker on bake duty. Then come home from work, decorate the cake yourself and deliver the cake the next day, that method can work.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when I talk of systems I’m also referring to ensuring you have a person who delivers the cakes for you. That way you’re not at work and trying to figure out how to deliver a cake. If your cake is ready, your delivery guy can just come, pick it up in the morning as you go to work and deliver your cake for you. Having systems in place is what actually really helps you balance having a job/being employed and running a baking business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any other business, starting a small bakery is not a smooth sailing venture. However, as long as you have figured out your target audience,  get the required equipment, get the required ingredients, have your recipes in place, figure out your workspace, get all the required licenses & permits and a marketing plan, you are ready to go.\n",

    "Sometimes ago I was having a talk with a friend of mine. He is the owner and proprietor of a school.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Buying a piece of land is one of the things everyone wants to do at one point in their life. This comes to pass at different times for everyone. Before buying land, everyone always has a plan behind the purchase; some to build homes, and for others is to do business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things don’t always go according to plan, and sometimes one might lack the finances to see their project to completion. This leaves them stranded with a piece of land and nothing to do with it. This, however, should not get you stressed, because with land you can never go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Land is one of the assets that appreciate with time, regardless of what is being done on it, or even just lying unoccupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I will give you tips on how you can earn despite having your land vacant and with this money you can be able to accomplish your end goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investing in real estate is a wise investment decision to make due to high returns associated with it. You can buy real estate e.g land for investment purposes and leave it vacant for its value to appreciate. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are one of such people, here are some of the things you could do to earn some income from that vacant land as you wait for it to appreciate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. Farming*\n",
    "\n",
    "Beekeeping or honey farming has huge untapped potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether a small or a large chunk of land you can reap big by starting this kind of farming. It is simple and relatively cheaper to start. An ideal location would be one away from noise and human disturbance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing you can do with a vacant piece of land is crop farming. If the land is fertile enough you can reap good produce and this will help you raise money to complete your project. You can also do other forms of farming in the land including dairy and also poultry farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can rent out your piece of land to someone willing to put it to use over a specified period of time as you gather resources to develop the piece of land, and when you are ready you can have your land back and begin building that dream home you were after or sell it at a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Dig a Borehole*\n",
    "\n",
    "Water is important in almost everything that we do. Digging a borehole is an easy way of getting some extra income from your land.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your land is closer to a town, you can set up a water kiosk and earn money from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Camping ground*\n",
    "\n",
    "If your land is in close proximity to a tourist area such as a lake, a park, or a mountain, you can turn it into a camping ground and rent it out to visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do this if your land provides a neat view or other features that people might be interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Carpentry*\n",
    "\n",
    "The demand for furniture is high. If you have a vacant land along a busy road then you can make a nice passive income from it by setting up a furniture shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also you can venture into timber business and use the land as a timber yard.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. Event venue*\n",
    "\n",
    "Make quick cash from your land by renting it out for different events. Corporate and social events such as weddings will pay good amounts to be hosted on nice grounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just start by doing proper landscaping and you are ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Parking lot*\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of motor vehicle units being bought in Kenya every year keeps rising. This makes parking business a potential multi-million shilling industry. If you have a vacant piece of land in Nairobi or in other towns around Kenya, you can reap big by turning it into a parking lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost and requirements for starting such a business are low. A 50*100 plot around Nairobi can fit about 25 cars each paying about ksh.200 per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "*7. Timber harvesting*\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the size of your vacant land, you could choose to venture into this kind of business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good thing with this business is that you can choose to do it yourself or lease out your land to lumber companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "*8. Set up a storage facility*\n",
    "\n",
    "The other creative way you could make use of vacant land is set up a storage facility. This can be a more lucrative business for those whose land is around airports, ports or in a town.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of money to be made from this business, from statistics, our export and imports as a country exceed our storage capacity. Note also that the capital required to set up a storage facility is not that much.\n",
    "\n",
    "*9. Set up a marketing space*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are one of the people whose land borders a busy highway or is strategically located, then you should consider reaching out to marketing or telecommunication companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the location, these companies can pay good sums of money to set up billboards (along busy highways) or network mast base stations (high altitude areas)\n",
    "\n",
    "*10. Lease it out*\n",
    "\n",
    "The economy of our country is agriculturally based. While waiting for your land to appreciate, you could simply lease it out for different types of farming say maize, wheat, watermelon, vegetables, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The income you can get from doing so is directly proportional to the size of your vacant land. All you need to start earning is to prepare a lease agreement and reach out to potential investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just some of the ways you can put an idle piece of land to use and make some money for yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the land as a private recreational park where people can come and hang out over the weekends or any other time for a small fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, Land is one of the assets that appreciate with time, regardless of what is being done on it, or even just lying unoccupied.\n",

    "\n",
    "The high number of events taking place has necessitated the need for catering services. Starting a catering business is a profitable venture in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the most common events that require catering services include corporate events, weddings, funerals, birthdays, baby showers, graduation parties, church events, political meetings e.t.c.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of stress and strain that comes with preparing food for guests. For instance, determining how much food will be needed and looking for cookery ware is stressing. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also expensive to buy cookery ware for a one day event. You can address the problem by preparing food for guests. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is how to start an outside catering business in Kenya. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Identify a Catchy Business Name*\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to find a good business name for your catering business. It will help you develop a brand for your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "A business name will help you in marketing your catering business name. A good business name should be easy to remember, unique and have a positive impression.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to register your business name on eCitizen portal to make sure it cannot be used by any other business. It will cost you around Ksh.1,000 to register a business name.   \n",
    "\n",
    "*Write a Catering Business Plan*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting a business, it is best that you write a business plan. A business plan will help you navigate through the competitive industry and also mitigate any risks and challenges you may face along the way. \n",

    "*A specialty\n",

    "\n",
    "*Sources of startup costs\n",

    "\n",
    "e.t.c\n",
    "\n",
    "*Identify a Specialty*\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first things you need to do is to identify a specialty for your business. For instance, you need to decide what your business catering niche is. You need to decide on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The food you will be serving your clients\n",
    "\n",
    "*The type of functions you will be serving\n",
    "\n",
    "*The capacity of guests your catering business can serve\n",
    "\n",
    "*Identify a Good Business Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "Business location is a significant factor in the success of any business. You need to identify a location with events that require catering services. For instance, you can set up your business in a location near gardens that host events.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can also start a catering business from your home. You will however need to advertise your business so that customers can know about its existence. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, you may need to have a business website or social media presence. For instance, you can create business page on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Make sure to post pictures of food that your catering business prepares.    \n",
    "\n",
    "A well marketed catering business may not need a very strategic location. This is a business which is not carried out in one place therefore, as long as you can get a room that can accommodate your kitchen equipment and a few members of staff, it can be located either in a residential area near where you live or even in your own house.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Buy Catering Equipment*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have everything in place, the next thing that you need to do is to buy catering equipment. Some of the catering equipment that you need to buy include:\n",

    "There is demand for scented perfume and even if you were to sell your product at 500% mark-up it would still be cheaper than most of the big brands on the shelves today. The secret to conquering this market when you are a small investor lies in producing a high quality product that can get you intimately connected with your target market.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what does it take to create a perfume brand that can be loved by many people? As it turns out, the underlying concept is very simple. You can even start a small “factory” in your bedroom and grow with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step One: Come Up With Your Secret Recipe*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your recipe is your business’s secret. And how do you come up with one? The answer in simple you need to roll up your sleeves and learn. Youtube is an example of a free platform where you can learn how to create a simple perfume recipe in a matter of minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many recipes being suggested out there, you only need to experiment with a few until you can find one which appeals to you so that you can make a product out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Two: Find Your Ingredients*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a perfume you only need three ingredients (how you mix them is what matters) – essential oils, ethanol and a fixative (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "Essential oils and fixatives are sold together and they are available at local fragrance shops and even on sites like Jiji.co.ke. Go for quality brands such as Ylang Ylang or ElCaptain.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for ethanol you can find it cheaply from those companies that manufacture methylated spirit or alcohol-based products. A good place to commence your search would be Kijabe Street (Nairobi), Industrial Area (Major towns) or Athi River (Machakos).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively you can use Vodka provided it’s the odourless type. Remember, what you cannot find locally, you can always import.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Three: Test Your Product*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have mixed all the ingredients according to your secret recipe you will be able to develop a final sample. Keep perfecting this sample until you’re sure it is the very best you can create. You can even spray yourself with it and ask your friends for an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Four: Market to a Small Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "The secret to succeeding in this market lies in creating an intimate connection with your customers. So start by selling your product to your friends, family and close accomplices. For instance, you can offer to be refilling their spray bottles at a competitive fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Five: Get KEBS License*\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4 above will help you understand your market even better and as such you will be able to improve the quality of your perfume. But before your product can be sold to the general public you will require to obtain a KEBS license. This will cost you Ksh.32,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Six: Brand Your Product*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to brand your perfume, you will require two things spray bottles (glass bottles) and a label.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import or buy locally 1,000 bottles to start with and these will cost you Ksh.10 each so set aside Ksh.15,000. As for the labels, you only need to approach a good designer cum printer for assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step Seven: Your Own Product*\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, your product is ready for the market. You have a brand, a KEBS license and an existing customer base. Now it is time to take on the big markets and swim with the big fish.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will require Ksh.50,000 to get up to Step 4 after which the business can become self-sustaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "This will depend on your pricing and brand positioning. But on estimation, a small entity can earn you over Ksh.100,000 per month if you do your homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that every big company you see out there started just as a small dream. Coca cola for instance only sold 25 bottles of soda during its first year of operation. KFC was started by an old retiree who was surviving on pension – but when he cooked a special chicken for his friends a global company was born.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even those big perfumes you see out there once started as small and hopeless entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its continuous marketing, persistence and consistence that keeps them going.\n",
    "\n",
    "So don’t let anybody tell you that you can’t do it. There is nothing that can stop you from starting your own perfume business in Kenya.\n",

    "\n",
    "Very often, we tend to underestimate the power of money that is in our grasp. Instead of swallowing the humble pie and starting small, we wait perpetually for bigger amounts so that we can do big things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this BIG money dream does not always come true and so we get stuck at the same financial state forever…and the cycle of poverty continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today I would like to show you just how much power Ksh.5,000 has. If you invest it wisely, you can build an empire with it. But if you choose to spend it, then you can as well buy a few snacks and drinks with it and make merry. The choice is yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Invest in unit trusts*\n",
    "\n",
    "Under unit trusts, you approach an investment company such as Britam, Genghis Capital or Old Mutual. You give them your Ksh.5,000 and allow them to invest it on your behalf. In turn, the investment company will add your money to their pool of resources (where other investors have put their money as well) and appoint a fund manager for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the year you can get decent returns for it – depending on how well the fund you invested in performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best thing about unit trusts is that you can start saving from as little as Ksh.500 per month. Moreover, you can receive sound financial advice from the investment company which you can then use to improve your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Invest in a Sacco*\n",
    "\n",
    "Investing your money in a SACCO will enable you to borrow up to three times what you saved. This means if you save Ksh.5,000 you can borrow up to Ksh.15,000 to do a further investment such as starting a business.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Start a Blog*\n",
    "\n",
    "The job of a blogger is to write articles that attract people to their blogs. The more traffic your blog gets, the more the business you can derive from it. For instance, you can apply for Google Adsense monetization program.\n",

    "*Write and sell eBooks*\n",
    "\n",
    "If blogging doesn’t sound like a good idea to you then you may want to consider writing eBooks and selling them on online retail sites such as Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing. Each time your eBook is downloaded you get royalties (70 percent royalty or 35 percent royalty depending on set policies).\n",

    "*Buy airtime scratch cards in wholesale and re-sell*\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For instance, you can source for business cards in Nairobi for Ksh.2 per piece and supply them upcountry for Ksh.8 per piece after designing them and printing them. If you don’t have a good printer for the job you can outsource printing services.\n",

    "29/06/2022, 12:28 pm - +254 754 839228: *HOW TO START A FURNITURE BUSINESS IN KENYA*\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that catches anyone’s attention after visiting any home is the furniture in it. The color, quality and make of the chairs, tables and wall units make the lounge beautiful. The comfort of the chairs can makes one feel relaxed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The furniture making business is a lucrative business in Kenya that does not require a lot of startup capital. You only need to have the necessary skills and passion. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quality and beauty of your furniture will attract customers. Therefore, it is important that you capitalize on that. \n",
    "\n",
    "When Sammy Njau started Tangerine Furniture business he only had his daily fare to a furniture showroom that he worked for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having no capital to start a business has been the bane of many youths in Kenya. As a result countless brilliant ideas get lost along the way, and dreams go unrealized.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this was never going to deter one determined Kenyan. He started from zero and, hardly a year down the line, his business has grown in into hundreds of thousands.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the story of Sammy Njau, a real estate graduate from the University of Nairobi and founder of Tangerine Furniture. He defied many obstacles to pursue his one passion: creating beautiful furniture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Located in Ngara, on the outskirts of Nairobi city centre, Tangerine offers a variety of furniture from sofa sets, dining sets, coffee tables and even curtains. Here, customers make their unique orders and immediately the technicians swing into action. The company has a showroom and its own workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Njau says when he started this modern furniture business he had no capital – just his day’s fare from his house to a furniture showroom that he worked for in at Ngara. “I was just a marketer in another furniture house with no money of my own. All I had was transport to take me from Thika Road to Ngara; but I had an idea, so I had to start with what I had.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most graduates who opt for employment, Sammy too could not resist the temptation. “It was not a real job,” he says, as he supervises final touches to a sofa set. “Just internship, that’s the closest I came to employment and I did not even finish it. It just din`t work for me.”\n",
    "\n",
    "So he turned himself into a broker. He would advertise his former employer’s furniture then earn commissions from any conversions. He marketed online largely, benefiting immensely from referrals accruing from the excellent services he had rendered to his clients. “You see you are not going to get referrals if yours is a shoddy work,” he asserts.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Passion for the best*\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon he started making his own and started the baby steps to creating Tangerine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Njau loves seeing beautiful spaces that create impressions. So unlike most businesspeople, money is less motivation than producing excellent pieces of work. “To me making state-of-the-art furniture is my passion. I believe in quality as opposed to quantity – producing master pieces that satisfy my client.”\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can he attribute his success to? “Honesty! Tangerine prides itself with being honest, and with passion we offer the best services,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Born or made, to him an entrepreneur should poses a certain set of character traits that include: consistency – to keep doing your work and stay put for period of time; flexibility – the ability to make some changes to accommodate new circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Those two may sound paradoxical, but entrepreneurship is a war of its kind, you can’t keep applying the same tactics you used to win yesterday. This is because circumstances keep changing. You need to keep up with competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "He advises up and coming entrepreneurs to make use of new technology, read all the books that you need to read, delegate when necessary, be persistent, adaptable and be flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get Carpentry Training*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are the one who will be making furniture for your business, then you need to get training. There are many vocational institutions in Kenya where you can train in carpentry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that customers want quality and unique furniture. You need to be highly skilled and make and incorporate creativity in furniture making. Ensure that you are always updated with current furniture trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t have the skills to make furniture, you can employ a carpenter to be making furniture for your business. Alternatively, you can buy ready-made furniture for sale in your furniture business.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get a Reliable Timber Supplier*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are involved in the making of furniture, you need to find a reliable timber supplier. You can source timber from a logger or a timber yard. Make sure to use quality timber for your furniture products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low quality timber makes poor quality furniture and customers will not buy your products. It would be best if you can use hard wood since its products are high quality and fetch more money.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get a Suitable Furniture Business Location*\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing is to find a suitable business location for your furniture business. The location should be easily accessible and visible from a far by passersby. You also need to have adequate space to place your furniture for display.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get a business location in a busy area like a town. The demand for furniture products is usually higher in towns compared to rural areas. It should also be in an area where it is easy to access timber.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Acquire Business Permits*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a legal requirement for any business operating in Kenya to get a business permit. You can get a business permit from the county government offices or the county council offices. Business permit fees vary from one county to the other, but it is between Ksh.5,000 and Ksh.10,000 a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Launch Your Furniture Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once everything is set up, you can launch your furniture business. At first, you will not have many customers until customers trust your skills. Strive to meet customer expectations to build a good business reputation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the items you can be making include office furniture, school furniture and home furniture. They include sofa sets, tables, chairs, desks, beds, wall units, wardrobes and cabinets. You can target schools, offices and homes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Market Your Furniture Business*\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to market your business by displaying furniture or through a word mouth, or social media. With time, your business will start having frequent customers and become profitable. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can visit schools and ask them if they would like someone to help them in making and repairing school desks. Many times, desks and lockers get broken in schools and need repairs. You can grab the opportunity to increase your revenues. \n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much Does it Cost to Start a Furniture Business in Kenya?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of starting a furniture business depends on the nature of your business. For example, do you make furniture or do your buy ready-made furniture for resale?  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is cheaper if your business will be involved in the making furniture compared to buying ready-made furniture. It will also give you higher profits margins. The cost of starting a furniture making business in Kenya is around Ksh.100,000. \n",

    "30/06/2022, 6:29 pm - +254 754 839228: *WHAT IF I FAIL?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, what if you succeed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why have you chosen to see this half-glass of water as ‘half-empty’ instead of ‘half-full’?\n",
    "\n",
    "The fear of failure is the most crippling reason why many of us will never start a business in our lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "We admire successful entrepreneurs as if they knew from the beginning that they would succeed. You should know that they had the same doubts like you do. They all feared for an uncertain future, an irregular income and total failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you fail?\n",
    "\n",
    "What if your business idea doesn’t sell or work?\n",
    "\n",
    "While these are very important questions, you may never know the answers unless you try.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of entrepreneurship, success and failure live in the same house. If you’re afraid of failure, there’s a very thin chance that you will ever taste success. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do you win a boxing match if you’re afraid of entering the ring?\n",
    "\n",
    "Business is, and has always been, about taking risks. That’s why entrepreneurs are known as ‘risk takers’.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is always an element of risk in everything we do in our daily lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Walking or driving to work (or school) every day is risky. Have you really thought about it? What if a car comes out from nowhere and crashes into you? Is it possible? Of course! Will you let that fear stop you from leaving your house? Definitely not!\n",
    "\n",
    "You still leave your house every morning knowing that the risk exists that you may not return. But you still take that risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of business, that risk is no different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a business is like writing an exam. You cannot read the examiner’s mind to know what questions will be asked, but you still show up and write the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "You took a risk; but a calculated one. By studying hard for the exam and practicing some test questions on your own, you were able to increase your chances of passing the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also to pass or fail an exam, you have to write it first. The same rule applies to starting a business. How can you know you will fail or succeed if you don’t start?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the hardworking student who studies hard for an exam, a smart entrepreneur must have a business plan. A business plan is a guide that often helps to reduce the chances of failure in a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "A student who has prepared well for an exam is more confident about his/her abilities to answer the exam questions and adapt to any ‘surprises.’ The same confidence applies to an entrepreneur who has taken his/her time and applied some discipline to prepare a plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "My most favorite quote that inspires me in times of fear comes from one of our continent’s greatest icons – Nelson Mandela. It goes:\n",
    "\n",
    "“I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody else could have said it better!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, a wiseman once said that the art of courage does not rest in the lack of fear, but in the willingness to take that step forward even when you don’t see the full staircase.\n",

    "\n",
    "You have probably heard about “business” in the real world. You grew up to know that whenever anyone talked about “business” the person is talking about buying and selling of certain things.\n",
    "\n",
    "However when you got to know about the internet, you started hearing the term, “internet business” or “making money online”.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this work?\n",
    "\n",
    "How do people make money online?\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, do people truly make money online?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to the last question is, yes, people (including me) make money online. But I will write an article on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question I want to answer today is, what is the difference between the internet business and a usual business in the physical world?\n",
    "\n",
    "My answer to that question is, NOTHING. Really, nothing much.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know my answer is over simplified, so let me explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, there is so much noise out there about making money online and the whole concept is usually presented like magic. “Hey, give us or invest with us Ksh.10,000 and you will be making Ksh.250,000 every month with little or no work” is the common noise out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds magical, doesnt it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now forget everything you have been told before and let me tell you the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business, either in the physical world, on the internet or inside water is not different. The basic foundation and principles are constant while the only variable is the medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give me a second and I will explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of every business is people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wherever there are people, there must be business. Wherever people live, go or visit, there have to be businesses, and of course, the more the people, the higher the business opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why there are more successful businesses in cities than towns, and in towns than in villages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you have understood this, I can proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some years ago there was no internet, so there wasn't anything called internet business.\n",
    "\n",
    "When internet started, nobody knew (or only few people knew) that there will ever be businesses on the web. But the law of nature remains rigid … wherever people go business must be there.\n",
    "\n",
    "If tomorrow people start visiting the moon or living inside water, you will start hearing terms like … moon business, water business or something similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that i have explained the foundation of every business (wherever people live, go or visit, there must be businesses), now lets talk about the unchanging business principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you like go and start a business inside the sun or inside Pluto, there are constant business principles you must understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the basic business principles…\n",
    "\n",
    "*You must sell something*\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easier to live without water than to make money (anywhere) without selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "If anyone ever presents any “make money online” idea to you and it doesn`t involve selling anything, you better laugh.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make money in the physical world by selling goods and services. The same principle is applicable online. We sell goods or services to make money online.\n",
    "\n",
    "While in the physical world, we sell more of physical goods and services, on the internet, we sell more of electronic and digital goods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still you have to note the word more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for instance, most giant companies on the internet are selling adverts to make money. Facebook, Yahoo! And google are examples you can easily identify with.\n",
    "\n",
    "But does that mean that advert selling is peculiar to the internet?\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever before you and I were born, there have been companies in the physical world which are selling advert space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, some earlier advert is dated to 4000 BC in India.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also take note that, though selling physical goods is common in the physical business world, many companies, small and large are selling physical goods on the internet. Jumia, Amazon are few examples you can quickly remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "My point here is, for there to be a business, there must be a selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The selling has to be of value … real value.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of “make money quickly” online is very common that most people making this noise usually dont tell people that you have to sell something of real value to make real money … anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have told you that you must sell. Now I am telling you, you must sell something that will help someone in one way or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to hear, “If you can just package this (especially information products) and price it #xyz, you will make #kkk each month”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats a lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, just like in the physical world, you can put together a crap, a junk, a fake product and start selling, but how far can you go with that?\n",
    "\n",
    "How much can you make with scam?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think you understand what I am saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have built a community of people on the internet. Again and again I have seen and heard people tell me, “thank you” after buying what I sold to them (on the internet).\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to understand what that means.\n",
    "\n",
    "It means you are giving value. It means people will come back again and again to buy what you are selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Nobody makes money from the first sales*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another business principle you must understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you understand this, you will never attempt selling crap or scamming people with substandard products or services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody makes money from the first sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coca-Cola has been selling coke from 1985. The reason why that company is rich is because they sell again, again and million times again.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is just as real in the physical world as it is on the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "I love facebook and can you guess the reason why I love facebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "No. not what you think.\n",
    "\n",
    "I love facebook because I run wonderful adverts through facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I run an advert on facebook, I see result, very good return on my investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats why I go again and again to facebook and “give” them my money. Thats why millions of people all over the world are begging facebook with their money every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "If facebook was mediocre, it would have taken me one poor experience (or two if I was a fool), to say “I can never advertise on facebook again”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Millions of other people would have concluded this way and, you get it, facebook will become poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody makes money by selling one time and if your products/services are average (or worse poor), people will only buy from you once or twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "No exception to this rule either in the physical world, on the internet or inside Jupiter (if business gets there)\n",
    "\n",
    "*No quick riches … no*\n",
    "\n",
    "I really wish there is a way to make money very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would have used such a way and became a billionaire. I would have taught all my relatives, my friends, and you (don’t be angry I won’t teach you first. Lol)\n",
    "\n",
    "I know we are all eager to be rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no quick money, quick success or quick anything worthwhile.\n",
    "\n",
    "While quick rich mentality is not common in the physical world businesses, that is the main bait online scammers use to catch their victims.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am here to tell you, it`s a lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a business is like giving birth to a baby. It takes time for your baby to become a man.\n",
    "\n",
    "I really wish there is a solution to this “problem”, so that I too may use it (because I too wish to become rich, quickly), but there is non.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Business requires knowledge and skills*\n",
    "\n",
    "When you think of business (whether online or offline), just think about medical science or law profession.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is so much to learn, but instead of people seeing it this way, they usually see internet business as different.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a term I usually hear on the internet. It is “internet marketing”\n",
    "\n",
    "I fell for this term and thought, “the marketing on the internet is different”.\n",
    "\n",
    "I later discovered by experience that marketing is marketing, whether online or offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have read some of the best marketing books about the physical world business and when I started reading the so called “internet marketing” books, I discovered that they are nothing but the repetition of the books I have read.\n",
    "\n",
    "To succeed in business (online or offline), you need business knowledge and skills and note, the skills you need are constant regardless of the medium (internet or inside moon)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody can teach you everything about business\n",
    "\n",
    "Internet “gurus” are fond of saying, “Hey, give me #5,000 and I will teach you everything you need to know about making money online”\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is, nobody can teach you everything you need to know about business, whether online or offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why i usually encourage people to read financial and business books.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Conclusion.*\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between the internet business and business in the physical world?\n",
    "\n",
    "The medium. Nothing much other than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "My advice for you is this.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever wish to be a successful business owner, get prepared and be willing to learn, try and fight.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Coca-Cola is the largest soft drinks manufacturer in the region that has managed to build a reputable brand for the past 7 decades. \n",
    "\n",
    "The soft drinks giant started its operations in Kenya way back in 1948 along Industrial Area’s Addis Ababa Road and today has four branches namely Nairobi Bottlers, Coastal Bottlers, Equator Bottlers and Almasi Beverages Ltd which is a merger between Mount Kenya, Kisii, and Rift Valley Bottlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the fact that Kenya is being ranked as one of the top 3 markets for Coca-Cola in Sub Saharan Africa, today we are going to look at some of the requirements one has to meet if they are interested to be a distributor of Coca-Cola products ( Sparkling Soft Drinks, Minute Maid Juice, Dasani water and Monster Energy).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Story of Yasmin Kamir - Coca Cola distributor*\n",
    "\n",
    "Yasmin Kamir is the owner of Eriza Investments Limited located in Ukunda which happens to be one of the leading Coca Cola distributors in the Coast region. However, she was not always a soda distributor, prior to this she used to run a small hardware shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her journey to becoming a Coca Cola distributor started off in 2013 while she was still running the hardware. It was during her daily commute to and from work that she noticed that the people in her area did not have access to sodas which happened to be in great demand due to the hot coastal weather. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spotting a business opportunity, she approached the person who used to distribute sodas in the area in a bid to know how she can get into the business. The individual intent on discouraging her from venturing into the business, told her that if she wanted to start, she needed to buy 150 crates of soda from him and that she would get be getting a profit of Ksh.10 per crate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the low margins, Yasmin saw an opportunity and she got a loan to purchase the crates and she started selling the sodas and due to the demand business was good.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some time, she decided to visit the distributor in her area hopping to get better prices for the sodas that the ones she was getting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, she found that the person whom she had been dealing with was the authorized distributor in the area so there was no way she was going to get a better deal. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as they say, every cloud has a silver lining in that during her visit to the distributor, she got to find out that he was struggling financially and could not be able to buy enough sodas from Coca Cola to meet the demand in the area. \n",
    "\n",
    "This confirmed to her that indeed there was a good business opportunity in selling sodas. It was at this point that she decided to buy a pickup which she started operating with her husband where she assumed the role of a saleslady. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point business really picked up as she was able to serve the market that the official distributor could not satisfy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, Nick Maina who was the Regional Manager for Coca Cola (which she didn’t know at the time) passed by her shop and asked for Ginger Ale, Fanta Strawberry, Soda Water and Club Soda. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nick was pleasantly surprised that she had all these products yet their official distributor in Changamwe did not have them. The next time she saw Nick, he was in the company of top officials from Coca Cola who included the then C.E.O Mr. Ebrahim. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nick had seen the potential in Yasmin’s business, and he urged the C.E.O to help her expand.  Mr. Ebrahim must have seen Yasmin’s passion for her business due to the fact that he told her to come see him in his office the following day. \n",
    "\n",
    "When she got to the office, Mr. Ebrahim reiterated his willingness to help her expand her business, but the only problem was that she did not have the resources needed to purchase more stock. It was at this point that Mr. Ebrahim asked her whether she had a title deed that she could use as collateral to access financing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, she had a title deed, Mr.  Ebrahim referred her to a bank manager who then issued her with a loan of Ksh. 1 Million to facilitate her expansion and this is when her business really kicked off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Come 2015, due to her hard work, she was made a full distributor and if that was not enough, she was also given a new lorry on flexible credit terms by Coastal Bottlers to help her distribute the sodas. She was able to finish paying for the lorry in good time and even emerged as the best distributor in that region. \n",
    "\n",
    "Her hard work paid off in that when a new region opened up, she was appointed as the official distributor and she was also given another lorry on credit to aid in distribution. She also bought a lorry from her proceeds because she could see that her business was growing and there was a need.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018, due to her good performance in the areas that she had been appointed as a distributor, she was also given the Ukunda area to manage thus expanding her business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2013, Yasmin’s business has grown in leaps and bounds in ways that she could not have imagined, and she gives all the credit to Coca Cola for aiding in her journey. That is from giving her vehicles on credit at a time when she could not afford to buy a new vehicle for her business to giving her stock worth over 10 Million on credit which have all aided her to be the successful business lady she is today.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Capital*\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a coca cola distributor, one must be able to raise a startup capital of between 3 million to 5 million Kenyan Shillings. You should also be able to obtain a bank guarantee of 2 million Kenyan Shillings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Computer Literate*\n",
    "\n",
    "One must be or have staff who are computer literate so as to be able to compute stocks and sales reconciliation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Storage*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important aspect in any business, especially if you plan to be a distributor. You will need a place to store your products after buying them in order to make the distribution easier. In this case, you will need a warehouse facility comprising a minimum of 2000 Square feet storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Target Market*\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be required to state your target market? Where are you going to be distributing the products? It is very important to state where your market interest lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Commitment to Nairobi Bottlers  limited Code of Business Ethics*\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of business ethics are explained in the coca cola website which falls under the Nairobi Bottlers Limited. The rules include:\n",

    "02/07/2022, 9:27 am - +254 754 839228: *THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT LUCRATIVE OR PROFITABLE BUSINESS IDEAS IN KENYA*\n",
    "\n",
    "There is this great misconception by people who are just planning to be business owners or who are new in the business world.\n",
    "\n",
    "They tend to see business as if some businesses are gold while others are stones. They tend to think, “If only I can get the gold, I will be rich in a short time”\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, if they can discover that profitable business idea, they will make it fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is ignorance!\n",
    "\n",
    "No business idea is gold and no business idea is stone, at least to a good extent. Selling cars in Kenya, we could assume is a very lucrative business, right? Yet, many people who are selling bottled water in Kenya are richer than car sellers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If my above analogy didn’t seem to make much sense, think about this one;\n",
    "\n",
    "I was with a friend of mine who is into poultry business and as we were talking he told me about some of his middlemen (or you call them middlewomen because they are women) who usually buy like 50 trays of eggs from him and other poultry farmers every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to him, these women make as much as Ksh.5,000 profit every day just by being eggs distributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ksh.5,000 in 25 working days (not to talk about some of them who work every day) means Ksh.125,000 a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend confessed to me, “Even we who are working tirelessly on the poultry farm are not making as much as they are making”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get me right! This is not to say that poultry business is not profitable. This is to show you that business profitability is not really what people think it is.\n",
    " \n",
    "It pains my heart sometimes when I look at some great business ignorance this days, but I know the cause. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why so many people assume that there are certain magical business ideas that are so much profitable and could make them millions in a short time is because so many people never for once consider or prepare to be an entrepreneur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entrepreneurship, for most people, is just a burden being placed on them by the lack of jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have prepared yourself well for entrepreneurship then you must already know that Businesses are NOT profitable; entrepreneurs make them so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of concentrating on searching for some magical lucrative businesses in Kenya, I will soon tell you what you should focus your attention on, but for now, let me make it very clear to you that business ideas are NOT like gold. No business is naturally profitable. It is smart business owners that make their businesses profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You take some time to look at any industry and you will see rich businesses and very poor businesses, in the same industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start from the richest industries in Kenya. Think about banking industries. There are very rich banks in Kenya and there are struggling banks too (don’t let me mention names), in the same industry, doing the same business.\n",
    "\n",
    "You think about the petroleum industry in Kenya. Is every company and business there rich and successful? No. There are very rich players and there are very poor, bankrupt businesses, in the Kenyan petroleum industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Which other industry can I use as an example in Kenya? Remind me please.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, telecommunication industry. By far, the telecom industry is one of the richest industries in the world. But is this a very profitable industry?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is telecom business lucrative? Yes and no.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be profitable for smart business owners and it can never be for the weak or ignorant entrepreneurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about Orange, YU mobile and other failed telecom businesses who had millions, invested it and lost it in the Kenya telecommunication business.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about the great success of Google and the fact that Google has virtually become the king of the internet with their more than 100 products (Gmail, YouTube, and many complex ones you may not understand), you will be tempted to think that search engine is a very lucrative business.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that will be a very wrong conclusion because there are hundreds of people who ventured into search engine business and failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, I have a friend who started a search engine business and probably never made a dollar from his venture. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because businesses are NOT naturally profitable. Businesses only become profitable when the owner (you) are smart and have business education (a lot of it) about the business you want to start or invest in.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s how great and profitable businesses are built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as I conclude this article, I would like to remind you to join our training on *WINES & SPIRITS BUSINESS*\n",

    "A lot of Kenyans drink alcohol. There are huge profits to be made in this business. \n",

    " \n",
    "Among the many small business idea choices in Kenya lies the barbershop business commonly known as kinyozi. This business ranges from executive barbershops to small and simple barbershops.\n",
    "\n",
    "A barbershop (locally known as Kinyozi) is a good example of a sustainable business because people will always need haircuts. Fashion styles may come and go, but hair cuts aren’t a fad or trend – they’re a basic necessity. Moreover, Kenya’s middle-class is growing at an alarming rate and you can jump onto this tide by starting your own executive barbershop.\n",
    "\n",
    "One good thing about Kinyozi business is that it is not seasonal. Business flows in as usual come rain come shine. This makes it a worthwhile venture to delve into. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I started writing about profitable businesses in Kenya in our Profitable Business Ideas WhatsApp Group, I got these questions a lot, “What’s the most profitable business in Kenya? What business can I start with Ksh.20,000 to make Ksh.1,000 daily? What is the best business in Kenya….”\n",
    "\n",
    "In my mind, all the three were tricky questions because — while one small business may be profitable to a specific entrepreneur, it may not be as much profitable to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not realize this so soon and so my answers kept conflicting…\n",
    "\n",
    "One day I would say, saloon business was the best, the next car wash, tents for hire… then grocery store business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not until sometimes ago when I was at my favorite Kinyozi (Wineca Executive Barbershop). The shop was full of executive clients waiting for executive cuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I thought to myself; if there are 15 seats in this shop — all serving — each client paying Ksh.300 for a cut,\n",
    "\n",
    "Then by the time we all walk out, the house makes Ksh.4,500. In like what, 30 minutes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not so much money after all, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now assume — each barber serves 5 clients per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give or take, this shop makes Ksh.22,500 per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothetically.\n",
    "\n",
    "If those figures don’t make this business the best then I don’t know what does.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Here are 5 more reasons why the Executive Barbershop Hustle is yet the best small business in Kenya.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Kenyan middle class is growing and with it, more people are willing to pay more money for executive things – haircuts being on the list.\n",
    "        \n",
    "*As an executive barbershop owner, you can make between Ksh.100 and Ksh.1,000 per cut depending on your locations, shaving style and after shaving services. For example, I pay Ksh.300 for my haircut in Wineca Kisumu — Ksh.500 for the same cut in TRM’s Kings and Queens Salon (Nairobi) and even more in other malls.\n",
    "        \n",
    "*With time, haircut customers develop personal relationships with barbers — where the dresser understands the client’s styles and vice versa. This is an advantage to the house because you are guaranteed to get repeat business if the last cut was good.\n",
    "        \n",
    "*Executive barbershop business does not require excess capital to start.\n",
    "        \n",
    "*Manpower to run the business is easily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1: Getting Started*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start your own barbershop you will need to become a barber. A beauty course in one of the many training centres in the country is inexpensive, and you can complete school and obtain your recommendations within a short period. \n",
    "\n",
    "If however you’re not interested in becoming a barber (or if you are busy with your current occupation) then you can always consider the option of hiring a trained barber.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 2: Find Ideal Premises*\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the ideal location is one that is easy to locate and access. Most first-time customers to your business will be walk-in customers and therefore it is important to maximize on available foot traffic by choosing a strategic location for your business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that you might be required to pay a good-will fee on some of the prime locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average rent prices in residential areas in urban centres vary from Ksh.5,000 – Ksh.15,000. The same unit may go for Ksh.1,000 – Ksh.5,000 in rural areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "High end streets attract premium rents of above Ksh.80 per square foot. Keep in mind that some landlords require payment of a deposit prior to moving in.\n",
    "\n",
    "So just to be safe, set aside a budget of Ksh.20,000 for premises if you are moving into a Ksh.10,000 per month premises.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 3: Shop Fit Out*\n",
    "\n",
    "Call in a carpenter to carry out a basic shop fit out. This may include installing mirrors, cabinets as well as painting the shop. On average carpentry labour costs Ksh.1,000 per day. The entire project may take three days and therefore you should budget for Ksh.15,000 or thereabout.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 4: Apply For Licenses*\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic form of license you will require in order to operate is the single business permit. Cost of this permit varies from county to county with small stalls attracting as little as Ksh.7,000 license cost per year in some regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Those in the Nairobi Metropolitan region are advised to set aside at least Ksh.20,000 for single business permit.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 5: Buy Equipment*\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example of a shopping list you can use. Note that it is not mandatory to buy all the items listed as you start. You can forego some of them and stock up on as the business grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2 Basic barber chairs – Ksh.10,000 each (Locally made)\n",
    "\n",
    "*2 WAHL Clippers – Ksh.3,000 each\n",
    "\n",
    "*Equipment Sterilizer – Ksh.10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Locally Made Sink Seat – Ksh.15,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cosmetic Products – Ksh.3,000 (Including spirit and after-shave)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fabric sheets, towels, apron – Ksh.3,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hair Style Charts – Ksh.1,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*2 Waiting or Lounge Chairs – Ksh.750 each (Plastic chairs)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Water heating & storage – Ksh.5,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Small Basins – Ksh.1,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Backup Generator – Ksh.50,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Entertainment System – Ksh.30,000\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 6: Build A Clientele*\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you start the business, you will need to build a clientele by giving great services and good value for money to your clients. \n",
    "\n",
    "That means treating each customer like royalty every time they step into your shop. Good customer service, neatness, good hygiene and reliability are just but a few qualities you should adopt to woo more loyal followers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Tips*\n",
    "\n",
    "-Evenings are peak hours as well as weekends and public holidays\n",
    "\n",
    "-You may consider adding a money agency business (e.g M-Pesa or Agency Bank) on the side to ensure steady supply of business\n",
    "\n",
    "-The business typically takes 6 months to reach peak\n",
    "\n",
    "-High-end executive barbershops charge Ksh.500 for a routine hair trim while standard ones charge Ksh.150. If you are targeting low income earners then Ksh.50 per trim would be a fair bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "-You will make more money by adding other services like hair dying, face scrubbing, face steaming, manicure and pedicure.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Invest*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are planning to start at full-scale operations then you will require a budget of at least Ksh.200,000 (For a standard executive barbershop). However you can always start small with Ksh.50,000 e.g. by reducing on your list of equipment and renting out a small room.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Much To Expect*\n",
    "\n",
    "On average a well performing Kinyozi can give a net profit of 30% of total investment per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final Word*\n",
    "\n",
    "The executive barbershop business idea is an ideal option for anyone who wishes to widen their fishing net. And you don’t have to be a trained barber to start one. You can simply use your entrepreneurial prowess to start, then train a few young men from your area and recruit them to work for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "That way you will not only have established a source of livelihood for yourself but also helped create employment for deserving young men and women.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your barbershop might take a few months to reach a peak. But, once it peaks and you have a loyal clientele, you are good to go. With time, your barbershop will expand in terms of profit, capacity, and personnel.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about it, go for it. A well-located executive barbershop can well be your side hustle or main hustle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also don`t forget to join our training on *WINES & SPIRITS BUSINESS*\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of Kenyans drink alcohol. There are huge profits to be made in this business. \n",

    "\n",
    "When I met Hezekiah Gatonye, he was holding a drinking glasses made from liquor bottles.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I make drinking glasses, flower vases and jars from bottles at my home in Likii estate in Laikipia East. I started the business five years ago after I lost my job in Nairobi following a tragic road accident that left me severely injured.\n",
    "\n",
    "I collect used bottles from dumpsites nearby bars and liquor shops.\n",
    "\n",
    "I make a line round the bottle at a predetermined size for easier separation. I use a candle to heat the bottle at the line by rotating it while holding on each end. I repeatedly heat it until I hear a slight cracking sound and the bottle breaks apart.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Hezekiah Gatonye separates bottle parts after heating around a cut line. He makes drinking glasses and flower vases from liquor bottles. \n",
    "\n",
    "I later smoothen the sharp and uneven rim using a sandpaper attached to an electric machine for faster results. I take five minutes to complete the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The glasses are then washed to remove the labels before selling.\n",
    "\n",
    "I sell the vases, jars and drinking glasses to homesteads, retail businesses that deal with utensils, individuals who visit my business and to wine and spirits shops and bars within Nanyuki town, Nakuru, Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and other towns in kenya.\n",
    "\n",
    "I make 60 drinking glasses in a day and other kinds of items like vases and jars with the help of 2 other employees and sell each glass at Sh.100 and other items between Ksh.100 to Ksh.500 depending on type and size. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a good day I make Sh.6,000 and Sh.3,000 when demand is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some clients bring their preferred liquor bottles and describe their favorite sizes of glass or flower vases.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, as it turns out, this venture is one of those profitable business opportunities that come dressed in rags.\n",

    "And you can easily confirm this by peeping into the latest wines and spirits wholesale prices in Kenya and then comparing the prices that wholesalers give retailers and the average retail prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually according to my source, the minimum profit you can make per bottle is Ksh.30 so do your math considering that you are dealing with fast moving goods.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every human being is born with a unique and special contribution to the world. The sad reality is, less than one percent of humanity is confident enough to find and exploit their natural potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, I have found that everyone has some skill or knowledge that can be turned into a business. The interesting thing about this principle is that you don’t need to be the best at anything to succeed in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of people make the mistake of thinking they have to be the best at something before they can make money out of it. Not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a reality check:\n",
    "\n",
    "The most gifted people in almost every field are usually too SCARED, and can hardly muster the guts to start a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered why most of the people who really start businesses in Africa don’t have MBAs and PhDs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, I believe the more a person knows about a subject, the greater the fear they have to take risks. I call it the ‘curse of knowledge.’\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is, you don’t need to have the largest fountain of knowledge to use it to your advantage. What you actually need is confidence to apply the knowledge that you have (or can learn). Unfortunately, most people do the reverse; they spend all their life acquiring more knowledge that they will never use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, knowledge is overrated. What we need is passion, creativity and courage to exploit the knowledge and skills we currently have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linda Ikeji isn’t the best writer in Nigeria, by any means. Yet, her blog is one of the most successful in Africa, earning her thousands of dollars in income every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linda is not a trained journalist, but millions of Nigerians depend on her blog for a daily dose of breaking news and society gossip.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying some creativity, she has successfully transformed her keen interest and passion into a viable business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faustina Sakyi, the highly successful Ghanaian cassava farmer is not by any means the most skilled cassava producer in her country. She doesn’t even have a university degree. \n",
    "\n",
    "But by applying some basic knowledge and experience in farming, she has transformed her small cassava and gari products into a multinational export commodity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just by applying ‘common sense’, this woman was able to earn enough money to rise out of poverty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bimbo Balogun was a novice at making African bead jewelry and was only ‘passing time’ with the art until she discovered by accident how lucrative a venture it was. Today, her bead jewelry is worn by celebrities and public figures in her country.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing is clear from the stories of these entrepreneurs: they are hardly masters or experts at what they do. Their successes prove that determination, passion and a will to take action with what you already have may just be all it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are your natural abilities in cooking, writing, organizing, farming or influencing people? Do you have a basic but specific knowledge of a trade, product or market?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you don’t have the knowledge or skills, but have a strong interest and passion for it, you can learn it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several free platforms on the internet e.g YouTube where Africans can learn anything for free these days.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should take out a sheet of paper and list all the things you know and can do quite well. Remember, you don’t have to be the best at any of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, I have found that most of the things on your list are likely to be things you have known all your life, and can do almost effortlessly, but you have always taken them for granted. People may have often praised these abilities but you never gave too much thought to it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Debt can be compared to your shoes. You have great heels that look fabulous, but hurt like hell. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have your flat shoes that appear boring, but are comfortable and you can still enjoy the use of your back in old age. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bad debts e.g car loans, furniture loans, holiday loans, wedding loans are like the high heels. We look fabulous in our cars, our furniture is the envy of all our friends but the monthly repayments we make are extremely painful. \n",
    "\n",
    "At one point in our lives we can all say we have lived beyond our means and we were able to recognize that fact. However some may be living beyond their means but they have no idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to find yourself in this kind of situation given the YOLO (You Only Live Once) mentality of today’s society and the need to fit into a particular class, created by lifestyle trends on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people live a lie. They drive big cars on loans that take them years to clear. They live in lavish apartments that they can barely afford to pay rent for. Others merely survive by relying on their family wealth and inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it may seem like they are doing better than you, you might be shocked to find out that they are spending sleepless nights hiding from creditors. You might be shocked to learn that they are stuck in a vicious cycle of poverty with no light at the end of the tunnel. The best kind of growth is the one that comes gradually.\n",
    "\n",
    "As much as it is good to fuel your growth through credit-finance, always make sure you have a healthy debt to equity ratio. This will help you enjoy life more, be more stable, achieve a better credit rating and above all achieve long-term financial success.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we all work so hard is to ensure we can afford a good lifestyle and that we can live in a good neighborhood. The unfortunate thing however is that what we earn may not always afford these little pleasures but we insist on getting them anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may earn a salary that can afford you a good house is say Ruiru but you cannot imagine having to tell your peers you live there because it may not be considered a posh enough neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "You therefore make the decision to live in Westlands or Kilimani or any other neighborhood that maybe considered leafy or posh. This in turn translates to you having to spend half or more of your income on rent.\n",
    "\n",
    " Financial experts often say you should not spend more than 28% of your income on rent. So if your take home salary is Ksh.30,000 per month, your rent should not be more than Ksh.8,400 per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rent is undoubtedly the biggest monthly expense for most young adults and families which is why there is a real need to keep it as low as possible. Such a recurrent expenditure should be limited to give room for other developmental expenses like investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are going through life with zero savings, you are living dangerously financially speaking. No matter how little your income is, you should be able to save a little of that money for a rainy day or for retirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If by the end of the month you have spent all your money and saving a little of it was the last thing on your mind then it is a clear sign you are living beyond your means and if not then you are well on your way there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial advisers generally agree that one should save at least 10 to 15 percent of their income at least for retirement if nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if your take home salary is Ksh.50,000, you should be setting aside at least Ksh.5,000 per month. If that is too high for whatever reason and you find you are having trouble setting aside even 5% of your monthly income, then there is a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continually setting a little money aside cushions you from life eventualities such as loss of a job or a sudden illness. Living with no savings can be compared to swimming in the big ocean without a life vest, you may survive for a while on your swimming skills but a big tide could end it all at any one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If by the end of the month you have already started taking things from your ‘mama mboga’ on credit and you keep calling your friends or colleagues for a soft loan to cater for your transport then you are definitely living beyond your means. \n",
    "\n",
    "Funding basic lifestyle costs using credit is one sure way to confirm you are living beyond your means.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter your salary, proper planning should ensure that the ‘little’ you get should get you through the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the money you take home lasts you the entire month, adjustments have to be made. That means no weekend binges on nyama choma and alcohol, no weekly take out because you feel too tired to cook, and no random trips with your boys/girls to Nakuru, Naivasha, Mombasa or any other ‘sin’ cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a budget helps you prioritize your money on what is really important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you one of those people who always wonder where their money went? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you can never account for your money then you are living beyond your means because you have no budget in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a budget, it is difficult to control spending and as such you will never be able to save or use your money sparingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "One should always live below their means. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not within but below. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means even if you can afford to live in a house worth Ksh.30,000 a month, if you do not absolutely have to, you can get a house for half that price and invest the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever found yourself at a point when you felt like everyone else was doing better than you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in college or University you used to be the most confident guy around. Always attending all lectures and getting top grades. \n",
    "\n",
    "By third-year, you had managed to get yourself a part-time job which meant you were above most of your classmates (financially-speaking). \n",
    "\n",
    "And on top of that, you managed to get a full-time job just a few days before sitting for your final exams. You did not “tarmac” and unlike your former classmates, you did not have to knock on endless doors hoping for a miracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "But your wave of success was short-lived, or so it seems, because just a few years down the line, the once broke guys started cruising around town with big 4×4 SUVs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ladies who you used to ignore suddenly became social media sensations – attracting numerous followers with each photo they posted on Instagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly, everyone seems to be doing better than you. This is despite the fact that you are working extremely hard in your middle-income job and trying your level best to save as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this story sound familiar? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if you think “YES that’s me” you probably would like to find out what changed. And as it turns out, you could be more of a victim of perceptions than reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chances are that, even though you are more successful than them, they own better phones than you. By capturing more visually stimulating photos and captioning them with nice words, they may appear like they are more successful than you but in reality they are just another lot of overhyped individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know, social media has the power to make small things look big and less important things look important. Don’t let the sheer numbers of the comments posted beneath their heavily filtered photos scare you.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are doing that for self-validation and you have no business trying to out-perform them in that. Look at the world’s most successful people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. You rarely see them bragging about their money or luxury items in public.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Finally*\n",
    "\n",
    "The road to financial success is one full of pot holes, hills, barriers and road blocks. Only very few manage to make it to the other side of the bridge of prosperity\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people remain poor, not because they don’t have the knowledge. Not because they don’t read business books and other business-related articles. But because they don’t LEARN BY DOING.\n",
    "\n",
    "You were born poor, but if you die poor you have yourself to blame.\n",
    "\n",
